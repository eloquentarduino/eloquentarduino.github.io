They uncover every single aspect you may encounter during your first steps and give a very sound introduction to the general topic of training, validating and testing a dataset on a model.</p>\n<p>If I will go on with this TinyML stuff, I'll probably buy a copy: I strongly recommend you to at least read the free sample.</p>\n<p>Once done reading the 6 chapters, I wanted to try the described tutorial on my ESP32. Sadly, it is not mentioned in the supported boards on the book, so I had to solve it by myself.</p>\n<p>In this post I'm going to make a sort of recap of my learnings about the steps you need to follow to implement TF models to a microcontroller and introduce you to a tiny library I wrote for the purpose of facilitating the deployment in the Arduino IDE: <a href=\"https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentTinyML\">EloquentTinyML</a>.</p>\n<h2>Building our first model</h2>\n<p>First of all, we need a model to deploy.</p>\n<p>The book guides us on building a neural network capable of predicting the sine value of a given number, in the range from 0 to Pi (3.14).</p>\n<p>It's an easy model to get started (the &quot;Hello world&quot; of machine learning, according to the authors), so we'll stick with it.</p>\n<p>I won't go into too much details about generating data and training the classifier, because I suppose you already know that part if you want to port Tensorflow on a microcontroller.</p>\n<p>Here's the code from the book.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import math\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\n\ndef get_model():\n    SAMPLES = 1000\n    np.random.seed(1337)\n    x_values = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=2*math.pi, size=SAMPLES)\n    # shuffle and add noise\n    np.random.shuffle(x_values)\n    y_values = np.sin(x_values)\n    y_values += 0.1 * np.random.randn(*y_values.shape)\n\n    # split into train, validation, test\n    TRAIN_SPLIT =  int(0.6 * SAMPLES)\n    TEST_SPLIT = int(0.2 * SAMPLES + TRAIN_SPLIT)\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate = np.split(x_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n    y_train, y_test, y_validate = np.split(y_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n\n    # create a NN with 2 layers of 16 neurons\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation=&#039;relu&#039;, input_shape=(1,)))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation=&#039;relu&#039;))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(1))\n    model.compile(optimizer=&#039;rmsprop&#039;, loss=&#039;mse&#039;, metrics=[&#039;mae&#039;])\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=200, batch_size=16,\n                        validation_data=(x_validate, y_validate))\n    return model</code></pre>\n<h2>Exporting the model</h2>\n<p>Now that we have a model, we need to convert it into a form ready to be deployed on our microcontroller.

            "content_text": "In this post I will show you how to easily deploy your Tensorflow Lite model to an ESP32 using the Arduino IDE without any compilation stuff.\n\n\nSo I finally settled on giving a try to TinyML, which is a way to deploy Tensorflow Lite models to microcontrollers.\nAs a first step, I downloaded the free chapters from the TinyML book website and rapidly skimmed through them.\nLet me say that, even if it starts from &quot;too beginner&quot; level for me (they explain why you need to use the arrow instead of the point to access a pointer's property), it is a very well written book. They uncover every single aspect you may encounter during your first steps and give a very sound introduction to the general topic of training, validating and testing a dataset on a model.\nIf I will go on with this TinyML stuff, I'll probably buy a copy: I strongly recommend you to at least read the free sample.\nOnce done reading the 6 chapters, I wanted to try the described tutorial on my ESP32. Sadly, it is not mentioned in the supported boards on the book, so I had to solve it by myself.\nIn this post I'm going to make a sort of recap of my learnings about the steps you need to follow to implement TF models to a microcontroller and introduce you to a tiny library I wrote for the purpose of facilitating the deployment in the Arduino IDE: EloquentTinyML.\nBuilding our first model\nFirst of all, we need a model to deploy.\nThe book guides us on building a neural network capable of predicting the sine value of a given number, in the range from 0 to Pi (3.14).\nIt's an easy model to get started (the &quot;Hello world&quot; of machine learning, according to the authors), so we'll stick with it.\nI won't go into too much details about generating data and training the classifier, because I suppose you already know that part if you want to port Tensorflow on a microcontroller.\nHere's the code from the book.\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\n\ndef get_model():\n    SAMPLES = 1000\n    np.random.seed(1337)\n    x_values = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=2*math.pi, size=SAMPLES)\n    # shuffle and add noise\n    np.random.shuffle(x_values)\n    y_values = np.sin(x_values)\n    y_values += 0.1 * np.random.randn(*y_values.shape)\n\n    # split into train, validation, test\n    TRAIN_SPLIT =  int(0.6 * SAMPLES)\n    TEST_SPLIT = int(0.2 * SAMPLES + TRAIN_SPLIT)\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate = np.split(x_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n    y_train, y_test, y_validate = np.split(y_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n\n    # create a NN with 2 layers of 16 neurons\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation=&#039;relu&#039;, input_shape=(1,)))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation=&#039;relu&#039;))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(1))\n    model.compile(optimizer=&#039;rmsprop&#039;, loss=&#039;mse&#039;, metrics=[&#039;mae&#039;])\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=200, batch_size=16,\n                        validation_data=(x_validate, y_validate))\n    return model\nExporting the model\nNow that we have a model, we need to convert it into a form ready to be deployed on our microcontroller. This is actually just an array of bytes that the TF interpreter will read to recreate the model.\nmodel = get_model()\nconverter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)\nconverter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE]\ntflite_model = converter.convert()\n\n# Save the model to disk\nopen(&quot;sine_model_quantized.tflite&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;).write(tflite_model)\nThen you have to convert to a C array in the command line.\nxxd -i sine_model_quantized.tflite &gt; sine_model_quantized.cc\nThis is copy-paste code that hardly would change, so, for ease my development cycle, I wrapped this little snippet in a tiny package you can use: it's called tinymlgen.\npip install tinymlgen\nfrom tinymlgen import port\n\nmodel = get_model()\nc_code = port(model, pretty_print=True)\nprint(c_code)\nI point you to the Github repo for a couple more options you can configure. \nUsing this package, you don't have to open a terminal and use the xxd program to get a usable result.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nUse the model\nNow it is finally the time we deploy the model on our microcontroller. \nThis part can be tricky, actually, if you don't have one of the supported boards in the book (Arduino Nano 33, SparkFun Edge or STM32F746G Discovery kit). \nI tried just setting &quot;ESP32&quot; as my target in the Arduino IDE and I got tons of errors.\nLuckily for us, a man called Wezley Sherman wrote a tutorial on how to get a TinyML project to compile using the PlatformIO environment.
