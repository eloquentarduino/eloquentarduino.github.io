SVM, on the other hand, computes 10 kernels and does 13 multiplications.\nThis is a recurring pattern, so RVM is much much faster in the inference process.\nDisclaimer\nmicromlgen and in particular port_rvm are work in progress: you may experience some glitches or it may not work in your specific case.
