Now you can use it on your microcontroller with ease.\n\nA brief recap on Stochastic Gradient Descent\nIf you ever worked with Machine learning, you surely know about Gradient descent: it is an iterative algorithm to optimize a loss function. \nIt is much general-purpose, in the sense that it is not bound to a particular application, but it has been heavily used in Neural networks in the recent years.\nYet, it can be used as a classifier on its own if you set its loss function as the classification error.\n\nThis is the core update rule of Gradient descent: quite simple.\nAs you see, there's a summation in the formula: this means we need to cycle through the entire training set to compute the update to the weights.\nIn case of large datasets, this can be slow or not possible at all.\nAnd requires a lot of memory.\nAnd we don't have memory on microcontrollers.\nSo we need Stochastic gradient descent.\nStochastic gradient descent has the same exact update rule, but it is applied on the single training sample.\nImagine the summation goes from 1 to 1, instead of m.\nThat's it.\n\nHow to use\nThe pattern of use is similar to that of the Passive Aggressive classifier: you have the fitOne and predict methods.\nFirst of all, download the library from Github.\n#include <EloquentSGD.h>\n#include <EloquentAccuracyScorer.h>\n#include "iris.h"\n\n#define VERBOSE\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    int trainSamples;\n    int retrainingCycles;\n    SGD<FEATURES_DIM> clf;\n    AccuracyScorer scorer;\n\n    // ....\n\n    // train\n    for (uint16_t cycle = 0; cycle < retrainingCycles; cycle++)\n        for (uint16_t i = 0; i < trainSamples; i++)\n            clf.fitOne(X[i], y[i]);\n\n    // predict\n    for (uint16_t i = trainSamples; i < DATASET_SIZE; i++) {\n        int predicted = clf.predict(X[i]);\n        int actual = y[i];\n\n        scorer.scoreOne(actual, predicted);\n    }\n\n    Serial.print("Accuracy: ");\n    Serial.print(round(100 * scorer.accuracy()));\n    Serial.print("% out of ");\n    Serial.print(scorer.support());\n    Serial.println(" predictions");\n}\nIn this case we're working with known datasets, so we cycle through them for the training, but if you're learning "on-line", from samples generated over time, it will work exactly the same.\nA bit of momentum\nStochastic gradient descent works quite well out of the box in most cases.\nSometimes, however, its updates can start "oscillating".\n\nTo solve this problem, it has been proposed the momentum technique, which can both speed up learning and increase the accuracy.\nIn my personal tests, I was able to achieve up to +5% in accuracy on the majority of datasets.\nTo use it, you only need to set a decay factor between 0 and 1.\nSGD clf;\n\nclf.momentum(0.5);\nRun on your own\nOn Github you can find the full example with some benchmark datasets to try on your own.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe example is interactive an will ask you how many samples to use for the training and how many times to cycle through them.\nThis is something you should consider: if you have a training set and can store it somehow (in memory or on Flash for example), re-presenting the same samples to the SGD classifier could (and probably will) increase its performance if done correctly.\nThis happens because the algorithm needs some time to converge and if it doesn't receive enough samples it won't learn properly.\nOf course, if you re-use the same samples over and over again, you're likely to overfit.\nL'articolo Stochastic Gradient Descent on your microcontroller proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

In this post we'll look into how to do it to classify colors.\n\nThis will be an hands-on guide, so let's walk throughout each step you need to complete to run the example. \nI setup this very example as a basis for your future projects, so you can easily swap the color classification task for any other one you could think of.\nDefinitions\n#ifdef ESP32\n#define min(a, b) (a) < (b) ?

You will need to keep this data always with you, since it's required also during the inference\ny_train: this array contains, for each training sample, the class it belongs to: 1 or -1\nlinearKernel: this is the kernel function for the SVM classifier (you can read more here). You can pass your own kernel other than linear (for example poly or rbf)\n\nIn this specific example, we're using the RGB class to handle the TCS3200 sensor reading, but this will change based on the dataset you want to train on. Also, since our features are going to be the R, G and B components of a color, FEATURES_DIM is set to 3.\nSetup\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    rgb.begin();\n\n    classifier.setC(5);\n    classifier.setTol(1e-5);\n    classifier.setMaxIter(10000);\n}\nThe setup does not contain any logic really. You can use this part to configure the parameters of the classifier:\n\nC: "The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points" (quoted from stackexchange)\ntol: "The tol parameter is a setting for the SVM's tolerance in optimization. Recall that yi(xi.w+b)-1 >= 0. For an SVM to be valid, all values must be greater than or equal to 0, and at least one value on each side needs to be "equal" to 0, which will be your support vectors. Since it is highly unlikely that you will actually get values equal perfectly to 0, you set tolerance to allow a bit of wiggle room." (quoted from pythonprogramming)\nmaxIter: set an upper bound to the number of iterations the algorithm can take to converge\npasses: max # of times to iterate over \u03b1\u2019s without changing\nalphaTol: alfpha coefficients determine which samples from the training set are to be considered support vectors and so be included during the inference procedure. This value discards support vectors with an alpha too small to be noticeable.\n\nFit\nelse if (command == "fit") {\n        Serial.print("How many samples will you record?

What if you could <strong>train</strong> a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?</p>\n<p><img src="%5C%22https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Onboard-IRIS-dataset-training-time.png%5C%22" alt='\"Onboard' iris dataset training time></p>\n<p><span id='\"more-982\"'></span></p>\n<p>When I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.</p>\n<p>As simple as this.</p>\n<p>Training is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.</p>\n<p>And this yield true until now.</p>\n<p>Until my reader <a href="%5C%22https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen%5C%22">Joao Carvalho</a>, in the comments on the post about <a href="%5C%22/2020/02/even-smaller-machine-learning-models-for-your-mcu/%5C%22">an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models</a> that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. </p>\n<p>In the past I replied <em>"No way"</em> to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a <a href="%5C%22https://github.com/karpathy/svmjs/blob/master/lib/svm.js%5C%22">Javascript implementation</a> of the <a href="%5C%22https://github.com/karpathy/svmjs/blob/master/test/smo.pdf%5C%22">simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm</a>.</p>\n<p>At a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.</p>\n<p>And in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.</p>\n<p>Then I deployed it to my ESP32 and... <strong>it worked</strong>!</p>\n<p>My first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.</p>\n<p>But I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.</p>\n<p>Execution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.<br>\nThe results are summarized in the following table and plots.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style='\"text-align:' center>Features size</th>\n<th

            "content_text": "As of now, we know it is possible to run Machine learning inference on tiny microcontrollers thanks to Tensorflow for Micro and my very own library MicroML. What if you could train a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?\n\n\nWhen I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.\nAs simple as this.\nTraining is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.\nMoreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.\nAnd this yield true until now.\nUntil my reader Joao Carvalho, in the comments on the post about an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. \nIn the past I replied "No way" to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a Javascript implementation of the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm.\nAt a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.\nAnd in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.\nThen I deployed it to my ESP32 and... it worked!\nMy first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.\nBut I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.\nExecution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.\nThe results are summarized in the following table and plots.\n\n\n\nFeatures size\nTraining size\nTraining time (ms)\nUnit inference time (ms)\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n4\n10\n0\n0,011\n80\n\n\n4\n20\n4\n0,013\n85\n\n\n4\n30\n11\n0,014\n90\n\n\n4\n40\n38\n0,017\n91\n\n\n4\n50\n47\n0,020\n86\n\n\n4\n60\n80\n0,025\n87\n\n\n30\n10\n22\n0,014\n71\n\n\n30\n20\n1000\n0,017\n61\n\n\n30\n30\n3500\n0,020\n66\n\n\n30\n40\n20000\n0,025\n85\n\n\n30\n50\n32800\n0,033\n83\n\n\n30\n60\n71400\n0,050\n80\n\n\n\n* all benchmark are obtained on an ESP32 board\n** the inference took actually sometimes less than 1ms to run for all the test samples, so it was rounded to 1ms and divided by the number of samples\n\n\nWe can see from the table that for the Iris dataset, which has 4-dimensional features, the training process is quite fast: 80ms to train on 60 samples.\nThings become much different when training on the Breast cancer dataset, with its 30 features per sample.

In particular, we'll distinguish handwritten digits using an ESP32 camera.\n\n\nIf this is the first time you're reading my blog, you may have missed that I'm on a journey to push the limits of Machine learning on embedded devices like the Arduino boards and ESP32.\nI started with accelerometer data classification, then did Wifi indoor positioning as a proof of concept.\nIn the last weeks, though, I undertook a more difficult path that is image classification.\nImage classification is where Convolutional Neural Networks really shine, but I'm here to question this settlement and demostrate that it is possible to come up with much lighter alternatives.\nIn this post we continue with the examples, replicating a "benchmark" dataset in Machine learning: the handwritten digits classification.\n\nIf you are curious about a specific image classification task you would like to see implemented, let me know in the comments: I'm always open to new ideas\n\nThe task\nThe objective of this example is to be able to tell what an handwritten digit is, taking as input a photo from the ESP32 camera.\nIn particular, we have 3 handwritten numbers and the task of our model will be to distinguish which image is what number.\n\nI only have a single image per digit, but you're free to draw as many samples as you like: it should help improve the performance of you're classifier.\n1. Feature extraction\nWhen dealing with images, if you use a CNN this step is often overlooked: CNNs are made on purpose to handle raw pixel values, so you just throw the image in and it is handled properly.\nWhen using other types of classifiers, it could help add a bit of feature engineering to help the classifier doing its job and achieve high accuracy.\nBut not this time.\nI wanted to be as "light" as possible in this demo, so I only took a couple steps during the feature acquisition:\n\nuse a grayscale image\ndownsample to a manageable size\nconvert it to black/white with a threshold\n\nI would hardly call this feature engineering.\nThis is an example of the result of this pipeline.\n\nThe code for this pipeline is really simple and is almost the same from the example on motion detection.\n#include "esp_camera.h"\n\n#define PWDN_GPIO_NUM     -1\n#define RESET_GPIO_NUM    15\n#define XCLK_GPIO_NUM     27\n#define SIOD_GPIO_NUM     22\n#define SIOC_GPIO_NUM     23\n#define Y9_GPIO_NUM       19\n#define Y8_GPIO_NUM       36\n#define Y7_GPIO_NUM       18\n#define Y6_GPIO_NUM       39\n#define Y5_GPIO_NUM        5\n#define Y4_GPIO_NUM       34\n#define Y3_GPIO_NUM       35\n#define Y2_GPIO_NUM       32\n#define VSYNC_GPIO_NUM    25\n#define HREF_GPIO_NUM     26\n#define PCLK_GPIO_NUM     21\n\n#define FRAME_SIZE FRAMESIZE_QQVGA\n#define WIDTH 160\n#define HEIGHT 120\n#define BLOCK_SIZE 5\n#define W (WIDTH / BLOCK_SIZE)\n#define H (HEIGHT / BLOCK_SIZE)\n#define THRESHOLD 127\n\ndouble features[H*W] = { 0 };\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    Serial.println(setup_camera(FRAME_SIZE) ?

Samples recording\nTo create your own dataset, you need a collection of handwritten digits.\nYou can do this part as you like, by using pieces of paper or a monitor. I used a tablet because it was well illuminated and I could open a bunch of tabs to keep a record of my samples.\nAs in the apple vs orange, keep in mind that you should be consistent during both the training phase and the inference phase.\nThis is why I used tape to fix my ESP32 camera to the desk and kept the tablet in the exact same position.\nIf you desire, you could experiment varying slightly the capturing setup during the training and see if your classifier still achieves good accuracy: this is a test I didn't make.\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\n4. The result\nOkay, at this point you should have all the working pieces to do handwritten digit image classification on your ESP32 camera. Include your model in the sketch and run the classification.\n#include "model.h"\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!capture_still()) {\n        Serial.println("Failed capture");\n        delay(2000);\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Serial.print("Number: ");\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n    delay(3000);\n}\nDone.\nYou can see a demo of my results in the video below.\n\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MNIST-mute.mp4\nProject figures\nMy dataset is composed of 25 training samples in total and the SVM with linear kernel produced 17 support vectors.\nOn my M5Stick camera board, the overhead for the model is 6.8 Kb of flash and the inference takes 7ms: not that bad!\n\r\nCheck the full project code on Github\nL'articolo Handwritten digit classification with Arduino and MicroML proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

            "content_text": "Do you have an ESP32 camera? \nWant to do image recognition directly on your ESP32, without a PC?\nIn this post we'll look into a very basic image recognition task: distinguish apples from oranges with machine learning.\n\n\nImage recognition is a very hot topic these days in the AI/ML landscape. Convolutional Neural Networks really shines in this task and can achieve almost perfect accuracy on many scenarios.\nSadly, you can't run CNN on your ESP32, they're just too large for a microcontroller.\nSince in this series about Machine Learning on Microcontrollers we're exploring the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at solving different classification tasks, we'll take a look into image classification too.\nTable of contentsWhat we're going to doFeatures definitionExtracting RGB componentsRecord samples imageTraining the classifierReal world exampleDisclaimer\nWhat we're going to do\nIn a previous post about color identification with Machine learning, we used an Arduino to detect the object we were pointing at with a color sensor (TCS3200) by its color: if we detected yellow, for example, we knew we had a banana in front of us.\nOf course such a process is not object recognition at all: yellow may be a banane, or a lemon, or an apple.\nObject inference, in that case, works only if you have exactly one object for a given color.\nThe objective of this post, instead, is to investigate if we can use the MicroML framework to do simple image recognition on the images from an ESP32 camera.\nThis is much more similar to the tasks you do on your PC with CNN or any other form of NN you are comfortable with. Sure, we will still apply some restrictions to fit the problem on a microcontroller, but this is a huge step forward compared to the simple color identification.\n\nIn this context, image recognition means deciding which class (from the trained ones) the current image belongs to. This algorithm can't locate interesting objects in the image, neither detect if an object is present in the frame. It will classify the current image based on the samples recorded during training.\n\nAs any beginning machine learning project about image classification worth of respect, our task will be to distinguish an orange from an apple.\nFeatures definition\nI have to admit that I rarely use NN, so I may be wrong here, but from the examples I read online it looks to me that features engineering is not a fundamental task with NN.\nThose few times I used CNN, I always used the whole image as input, as-is. I didn't extracted any feature from them (e.g. color histogram): the CNN worked perfectly fine with raw images.\nI don't think this will work best with SVM, but in this first post we're starting as simple as possible, so we'll be using the RGB components of the image as our features. In a future post, we'll introduce additional features to try to improve our results.\nI said we're using the RGB components of the image. But not all of them.\nEven at the lowest resolution of 160x120 pixels, a raw RGB image from the camera would generate 160x120x3 = 57600 features: way too much.\nWe need to reduce this number  to the bare minimum.\nHow much pixels do you think are necessary to get reasonable results in this task of classifying apples from oranges?\nYou would be surprised to know that I got 90% accuracy with an RGB image of 8x6!\n\nYes, that's all we really need to do a good enough classification.\nYou can distinguish apples from oranges on ESP32 with 8x6 pixels only!Click To Tweet\nOf course this is a tradeoff: you can't expect to achieve 99% accuracy while mantaining the model size small enough to fit on a microcontroller. 90% is an acceptable accuracy for me in this context.\nYou have to keep in mind, moreover, that the features vector size grows quadratically with the image size (if you keep the aspect ratio). A raw RGB image of 8x6 generates 144 features: an image of 16x12 generates 576 features. This was already causing random crashes on my ESP32.\nSo we'll stick to 8x6 images.\nNow, how do you compact a 160x120 image to 8x6? With downsampling.\nThis is the same tecnique we've used in the post about motion detection on ESP32: we define a block size and average all the pixels inside the block to get a single value (you can refer to that post for more details).\n\nThis time, though, we're working with RGB images instead of grayscale, so we'll repeat the exact same process 3 times, one for each channel.\nThis is the code excerpt that does the downsampling.\nuint16_t rgb_frame[HEIGHT / BLOCK_SIZE][WIDTH / BLOCK_SIZE][3] = { 0 };\n\nvoid grab_image() {\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i += 2) {\n        // get r, g, b from the buffer\n        // see later\n\n        const size_t j = i / 2;\n        // transform x, y in the original image to x, y in the downsampled image\n        // by dividing by BLOCK_SIZE\n        const uint16_t x = j % WIDTH;\n        const uint16_t y = floor(j / WIDTH);\n        const uint8_t block_x = floor(x / BLOCK_SIZE);\n        const uint8_t block_y = floor(y / BLOCK_SIZE);\n\n        // average pixels in block (accumulate)\n        rgb_frame[block_y][block_x][0] += r;\n        rgb_frame[block_y][block_x][1] += g;\n        rgb_frame[block_y][block_x][2] += b;\n    }\n}\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nExtracting RGB components\nThe ESP32 camera can store the image in different formats (of our interest \u2014 there are a couple more available):\n\ngrayscale: no color information, just the intensity is stored. The buffer has size HEIGHT*WIDTH\nRGB565: stores each RGB pixel in two bytes, with 5 bit for red, 6 for green and 5 for blue. The buffer has size HEIGHT * WIDTH * 2\nJPEG: encodes (in hardware?) the image to jpeg. The buffer has a variable length, based on the encoding results\n\nFor our purpose, we'll use the RGB565 format and extract the 3 components from the 2 bytes with the following code.\n\nconfig.pixel_format = PIXFORMAT_RGB565;\n\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < len; i += 2) {\n    const uint8_t high = buf[i];\n    const uint8_t low  = buf[i+1];\n    const uint16_t pixel = (high << 8) | low;\n\n    const uint8_t r = (pixel & 0b1111100000000000) >> 11;\n    const uint8_t g = (pixel & 0b0000011111100000) >> 6;\n    const uint8_t b = (pixel & 0b0000000000011111);\n}\nRecord samples image\nNow that we can grab the images from the camera, we'll need to take a few samples of each object we want to racognize.\nBefore doing so, we'll linearize the image matrix to a 1-dimensional vector, because that's what our prediction function expects.\n#define H (HEIGHT / BLOCK_SIZE)\n#define W (WIDTH / BLOCK_SIZE)\n\nvoid linearize_features() {\n  size_t i = 0;\n  double features[H*W*3] = {0};\n\n  for (int y = 0; y < H; y++) {\n    for (int x = 0; x < W; x++) {\n      features[i++] = rgb_frame[y][x][0];\n      features[i++] = rgb_frame[y][x][1];\n      features[i++] = rgb_frame[y][x][2];\n    }\n  }\n\n  // print to serial\n  for (size_t i = 0; i < H*W*3; i++) {\n    Serial.print(features[i]);\n    Serial.print('\\t');\n  }\n\n  Serial.println();\n}\nNow you can setup your acquisition environment and take the samples: 15-20 of each object will do the job.\n\nImage acquisition is a very noisy process: even keeping the camera still, you will get fluctuating values. You need to be very accurate during this phase if you want to achieve good results. I suggest you immobilize your camera with tape to a flat surface or use some kind of photographic easel.\n\nTraining the classifier\nTo train the classifier, save the features for each object in a file, one features vector per line. Then follow the steps on how to train a ML classifier for Arduino to get the exported model.\nYou can experiment with different classifier configurations. \nMy features were well distinguishable, so I had great results (100% accuracy) with any kernel (even linear).\nOne odd thing happened with the RBF kernel: I had to use an extremely low gamma value (0.0000001). Does anyone can explain me why? I usually go with a default value of 0.001.\nThe model produced 13 support vectors.\nI did no features scaling: you could try it if classifying more than 2 classes and having poor results.\n\nReal world example\nIf you followed all the steps above, you should now have a model capable of detecting if your camera is shotting an apple or an orange, as you can see in the following video.\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-vs-Orange.mp4\n\nThe little white object you see at the bottom of the image is the camera, taped to the desk.\nDid you think it was possible to do simple image classification on your ESP32?\nDisclaimer\nThis is not full-fledged object recognition: it can't label objects while you walk as Tensorflow can do, for example.\nYou have to carefully craft your setup and be as consistent as possible between training and inferencing.\nStill, I think this is a fun proof-of-concept that can have useful applications in simple scenarios where you can live with a fixed camera and don't want to use a full Raspberry Pi.\nIn the next weeks I settled to finally try TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers on my ESP32, so I'll try to do a comparison between them and this example and report my results.\nNow that you can do image classification on your ESP32, can you think of a use case you will be able to apply this code to? \nLet me know in the comments, we could even try realize it together if you need some help.\n\r\nCheck the full project code on Github\nL'articolo Apple or Orange?

            "content_text": "You won't believe it, but you can run Machine learning on embedded systems like an Attiny85 (and many others Attiny)!\n\n\nWhen I first run a Machine learning project on my Arduino Nano (old generation), it already felt a big achievement. I mean, that board has only 32 Kb of program space and 2 Kb of RAM and you can buy a chinese clone for around 2.50 $.\nIt already opened the path to a embedded machine learning at a new scale, given the huge amount of microcontrollers ready to become "intelligent". \nBut it was not enough for me: after all, the MicroML generator exports plain C that should run on any embedded system, not only on Arduino boards.\nSo I setup to test if I could go even smaller and run it on the #1 of tiny chips: the Attiny85.\nMicroML exports plain C that could run anywhere, not only on Arduino boards.Click To Tweet\nNo, I couldn't.\nThe generated code makes use of a variadic function, which seems to not be supported by the Attiny compiler in the Arduino IDE.\nSo I had to come up with an alternative implementation to make it work.\nFortunately I already experimented with a non-variadic version when first writing the porter, so it was a matter of refreshing that algorithm and try it out.\nGuess what? It compiled!\nSo I tried porting one my earliear tutorial (the color identification one) to the Attiny and...\nBoom! Machine learning on an Attiny85!Click To Tweet\nHere's a step-by-step tutorial on how you can do it too.\n\nI strongly suggest you read the original tutorial before following this one, because I won't go into too much details on the common steps here.\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataTrain and export the SVM classifierRun the inferenceProject figures\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the RGB components of a color sensor (TCS3200 in my case) to infer which object we're pointing it at. This means our features are going to be 3-dimensional, which leads to a really simple model with very high accuracy.\n\nThe Attiny85 has 8 Kb of flash and 512 bytes of RAM, so you won't be able to load any model that uses more than a few features (probably less than 10).\n\n2. Record sample data\nYou must do this step on a board with a Serial interface, like an Arduino Uno / Nano / Pro Mini. See the original tutorial for the code of this step.\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\nThis part is exactly the same as the original, except for a single parameter: you will pass platform=attiny to the port function.\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom micromlgen import port\n\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\n# one class per file\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap, platform='attiny')\nprint(c_code)\n\nThe Attiny mode has been implemented in version 0.8 of micromlgen: if you installed an earlier version, first update\n\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your project, in a file called model.h.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n4.

Features definition\nThe microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. \n\nWhen working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with Fourier Transform, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.\n2. Record sample data\nFirst of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.\n\n#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}\n2.1 Translate the raw values\nFor the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. analogRead() is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.\nint16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) >> 2;\n}\n2.2 Detect sound\nAs in the tutorial about gesture classification, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.\nTo do this, we first record a "background" sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.\nfloat backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print("Background sound level is ");\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}\nAt this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.\n// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) >= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.3 Record the words\nAs for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.\nI made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.\n\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n2.4 Fast Fourier Transform\nHere we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. \nLuckily for us, there exists a library for Arduino that does FFT.\nAnd is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!\n#include <arduinoFFT.h>\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}\nYou don't need to know what the Windowing function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.\nAt this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.\n\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it. You will lose some accuracy, but your model will be smaller.\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily.\nAudio is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\n2.5 Select a suitable model\nHere's an overview table of the 3 tests I did.\n\n\n\nKernel\nNo. support vectors\nAvg. accuracy\n\n\n\n\nLinear\n22\n87%\n\n\nPoly 3\n29\n91%\n\n\nRBF\n36\n94%\n\n\n\nOf course the one with the RBF kernel would be the most desiderable since it has a very high accuracy: 36 support vectors, tough, will produce a model too large to fit on an Arduino Nano.\nSo you're forced to pick the one with the highest accuracy that fit on your board: in my case it was the Linear kernel one.\n4. Run the inference\n#include "model.h"\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    Serial.print("You said ");\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n\n    delay(1000);\n}\nAnd that's it: word classification through machine learning on your Arduino board! Say some word and see the classification result on the Serial monitor. \nHere's me testing the system (English is not my language, so forgive my bad pronounce). The video quality is very low, I know, but you get the point.\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Word-classification.mp4\n\nAs you can hear from the video, you should be quite accurate when pronouncing the words. I have to admit there are cases where the system totally fails to classify correctly the words. Restarting helps most of the time, so I'm suspecting there could be some kind of leak that \"corrupts\" the inference procedure.\n\nDid you find this tutorial useful? Was is it easy to follow or did I miss something?
