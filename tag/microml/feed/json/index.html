Convolutional Neural Networks really shines in this task and can achieve almost perfect accuracy on many scenarios.\nSadly, you can't run CNN on your ESP32, they're just too large for a microcontroller.\nSince in this series about Machine Learning on Microcontrollers we're exploring the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at solving different classification tasks, we'll take a look into image classification too.\nTable of contentsWhat we're going to doFeatures definitionExtracting RGB componentsRecord samples imageTraining the classifierReal world exampleDisclaimer\nWhat we're going to do\nIn a previous post about color identification with Machine learning, we used an Arduino to detect the object we were pointing at with a color sensor (TCS3200) by its color: if we detected yellow, for example, we knew we had a banana in front of us.\nOf course such a process is not object recognition at all: yellow may be a banane, or a lemon, or an apple.\nObject inference, in that case, works only if you have exactly one object for a given color.\nThe objective of this post, instead, is to investigate if we can use the MicroML framework to do simple image recognition on the images from an ESP32 camera.\nThis is much more similar to the tasks you do on your PC with CNN or any other form of NN you are comfortable with. Sure, we will still apply some restrictions to fit the problem on a microcontroller, but this is a huge step forward compared to the simple color identification.\n\nIn this context, image recognition means deciding which class (from the trained ones) the current image belongs to. This algorithm can't locate interesting objects in the image, neither detect if an object is present in the frame. It will classify the current image based on the samples recorded during training.\n\nAs any beginning machine learning project about image classification worth of respect, our task will be to distinguish an orange from an apple.\nFeatures definition\nI have to admit that I rarely use NN, so I may be wrong here, but from the examples I read online it looks to me that features engineering is not a fundamental task with NN.\nThose few times I used CNN, I always used the whole image as input, as-is. I didn't extracted any feature from them (e.g. color histogram): the CNN worked perfectly fine with raw images.\nI don't think this will work best with SVM, but in this first post we're starting as simple as possible, so we'll be using the RGB components of the image as our features.

You need to be very accurate during this phase if you want to achieve good results. I suggest you immobilize your camera with tape to a flat surface or use some kind of photographic easel.\n\nTraining the classifier\nTo train the classifier, save the features for each object in a file, one features vector per line. Then follow the steps on how to train a ML classifier for Arduino to get the exported model.\nYou can experiment with different classifier configurations. \nMy features were well distinguishable, so I had great results (100% accuracy) with any kernel (even linear).\nOne odd thing happened with the RBF kernel: I had to use an extremely low gamma value (0.0000001).

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning tutorial we're going to use a microphone to identify the word you speak.\nThis is going to run on an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nIn this project the features are going to be the Fast Fourier Transform of 50 analog readings from a microphone, taken starting from when a loud sound is detected, sampled at intervals of 5 millis.\n\nThis tutorial is not about \"Wake word\" detection: it can't distinguish a known word from any other word. It can classify the word you speak among the ones you trained it to recognize!!!\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataTranslate the raw valuesDetect soundRecord the wordsFast Fourier TransformTrain and export the SVM classifierSelect a suitable modelRun the inference\n1. Features definition\nThe microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. \n\nWhen working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with Fourier Transform, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.\n2. Record sample data\nFirst of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.\n\n#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}\n2.1 Translate the raw values\nFor the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. analogRead() is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.\nint16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) >> 2;\n}\n2.2 Detect sound\nAs in the tutorial about gesture classification, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.\nTo do this, we first record a "background" sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.\nfloat backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print("Background sound level is ");\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}\nAt this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.\n// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) >= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.3 Record the words\nAs for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.\nI made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.\n\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n2.4 Fast Fourier Transform\nHere we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. \nLuckily for us, there exists a library for Arduino that does FFT.\nAnd is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!\n#include <arduinoFFT.h>\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}\nYou don't need to know what the Windowing function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.\nAt this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.\n\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it. You will lose some accuracy, but your model will be smaller.\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily.\nAudio is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\n2.5 Select a suitable model\nHere's an overview table of the 3 tests I did.\n\n\n\nKernel\nNo. support vectors\nAvg. accuracy\n\n\n\n\nLinear\n22\n87%\n\n\nPoly 3\n29\n91%\n\n\nRBF\n36\n94%\n\n\n\nOf course the one with the RBF kernel would be the most desiderable since it has a very high accuracy: 36 support vectors, tough, will produce a model too large to fit on an Arduino Nano.\nSo you're forced to pick the one with the highest accuracy that fit on your board: in my case it was the Linear kernel one.\n4.

GPS works very well and with a very high accuracy (you can expect only a few meters of error).</p>\n<p>But it suffers a problem: it needs <em>Line of Sight</em> (a clear path from your device to the satellites). If you're not in an open place, like inside a building, you're out of luck.</p>\n<p>The task of detecting where you are when GPS localization is not an option is called <a href="%5C%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_positioning_system%5C%22">indoor positioning</a>: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. </p>\n<p>There are lots of different approaches to this task (Wikipedia lists more than 10 of them), each with a varying level of commitment, difficulty, cost and accuracy.</p>\n<p>For this tutorial I opted for one that is both cost-efficient, easy to implement and readily available in most of the locations: <strong>WiFi indoor positioning</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id='\"tocwhat-will-we-use-it-for\"'>What will we use it for?</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial about Machine learning on Arduino we're going to use Wifi indoor positioning to detect in which room of our house / office we are. This is the most basic task we can accomplish and will get us a feeling of level of accuracy we can achieve with such a simple setup.</p>\n<p>On this basis, we'll construct more sophisticated projects in future posts.</p>\n<h3 id='\"tocwhat-you-need\"'>What you need</h3>\n<p>To accomplish this tutorial, you really need 2 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a WiFi equipped board (ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino MKR WiFi 1010...)</li>\n<li>be in a place with a few WiFi networks around</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're doing this at home or in your office, there's a good change your neighbours have WiFi networks in their apartments you can leverage. If you live in an isolated contryside, sorry, this will not work for you.</p>\n<h3 id='\"tochow-it-works\"'>How it works</h3>\n<p>So, how exactly does Wifi indoor positioning works in conjuction with Machine learning? </p>\n<p>Let's pretend there are 5 different WiFi networks around you, like in the picture below.</p>\n<p><img src="%5C%22https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wifi1.png%5C%22" alt='\"Wifi' indoor positioning example></p>\n<p>As you can see there are two markers on the map: each of these markers will "see" different networks, with different <em>signal strengths</em> (a.k.a <a href="%5C%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication%5C%22">RSSI</a>).</p>\n<p>As you move around, those numbers will change: each room will be identified by the unique combination of the RSSIs.</p>\n<h2 id='\"tocfeatures-definition\"'>1.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use the nearby WiFi access points to locate where we are. For this project to work you will need a Wifi equipped board, such as ESP8266 or ESP32.\n\n\nTable of contentsWhat is indoor positioning?What will we use it for?What you needHow it worksFeatures definitionRecord sample dataEnumerate the access pointsCreate an access point arrayConvert to features vectorTrain and export the SVM classifierRun the inference\nWhat is indoor positioning?\nWe all are used to GPS positioning: our device will use satellites to track our position on Earth. GPS works very well and with a very high accuracy (you can expect only a few meters of error).\nBut it suffers a problem: it needs Line of Sight (a clear path from your device to the satellites). If you're not in an open place, like inside a building, you're out of luck.\nThe task of detecting where you are when GPS localization is not an option is called indoor positioning: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. \nThere are lots of different approaches to this task (Wikipedia lists more than 10 of them), each with a varying level of commitment, difficulty, cost and accuracy.\nFor this tutorial I opted for one that is both cost-efficient, easy to implement and readily available in most of the locations: WiFi indoor positioning.\nWhat will we use it for?\nIn this tutorial about Machine learning on Arduino we're going to use Wifi indoor positioning to detect in which room of our house / office we are. This is the most basic task we can accomplish and will get us a feeling of level of accuracy we can achieve with such a simple setup.\nOn this basis, we'll construct more sophisticated projects in future posts.\nWhat you need\nTo accomplish this tutorial, you really need 2 things:\n\na WiFi equipped board (ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino MKR WiFi 1010...)\nbe in a place with a few WiFi networks around\n\nIf you're doing this at home or in your office, there's a good change your neighbours have WiFi networks in their apartments you can leverage. If you live in an isolated contryside, sorry, this will not work for you.\nHow it works\nSo, how exactly does Wifi indoor positioning works in conjuction with Machine learning? \nLet's pretend there are 5 different WiFi networks around you, like in the picture below.\n\nAs you can see there are two markers on the map: each of these markers will "see" different networks, with different signal strengths (a.k.a RSSI).\nAs you move around, those numbers will change: each room will be identified by the unique combination of the RSSIs.\n1. Features definition\nThe features for this project are going to be the RSSIs (Received signal strength indication) of the known WiFi networks. If a network is out of range, it will have an RSSI equal to 0.\n2. Record sample data\nBefore actually recording the sample data to train our classifier, we need to do some preliminary work. This is because not all networks will be visible all the time:  we have to work, however, with a fixed number of features.\n2.1 Enumerate the access points\nFirst of all we need to enumerate all the networks we will encounter during the inference process. \nTo begin, we take a "reconnaissance tour" of the locations we want to predict and log all the networks we detect. Load the following sketch and take note of all the networks that appear on the Serial monitor.\n#include <WiFi.h>\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < numNetworks; i++) {\n      Serial.println(WiFi.SSID(i));\n\n  delay(3000);\n}\n2.2 Create an access point array\nNow that we have a bunch of SSIDs, we need to assign each SSID to a fixed index, from 0 to MAX_NETWORKS.\nYou can implement this part as you like, but in this demo I'll make use of a class I wrote called Array (you can see the source code and example on Github), which implements 2 useful functions: \n\npush() to add an element to the array\nindexOf() to get the index of an element.\n\nSee how to install the Eloquent library if you don't have it already installed.\nAt this point we populate the array with all the networks we saved from the reconnaissance tour.\n#include <eDataStructures.h>\n\n#define MAX_NETWORKS 10\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::DataStructures;\n\ndouble features[MAX_NETWORKS];\nArray<String, MAX_NETWORKS> knownNetworks("");\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n\n    knownNetworks.push("SSID #0");\n    knownNetworks.push("SSID #1");\n    knownNetworks.push("SSID #2");\n    knownNetworks.push("SSID #3");\n    // and so on\n}\n2.3 Convert to features vector\nThe second step is to convert the scan results into a features vector. Each feature will be the RSSI of the given SSID, in the exact order we populated the knownNetworks array.\nIn practice:\nfeatures[0] == RSSI of SSID #0;\nfeatures[1] == RSSI of SSID #1;\nfeatures[2] == RSSI of SSID #2;\nfeatures[3] == RSSI of SSID #3;\n// and so on\nThe code below will do the job.\nvoid loop() {\n    scan();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid scan() {\n    int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n    resetFeatures();\n\n    // assign RSSIs to feature vector\n    for (int i = 0; i < numNetworks; i++) {\n        String ssid = WiFi.SSID(i);\n        uint16_t networkIndex = knownNetworks.indexOf(ssid);\n\n        // only create feature if the current SSID is a known one\n        if (!isnan(networkIndex))\n            features[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n    }\n}\n\n// reset all features to 0\nvoid resetFeatures() {\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFeatues; i++)\n        features[i] = 0;\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nGrab some recordings just staying in a location for a few seconds and save the serial output to a file; then move to the next location and repeat: 10-15 samples for each location will suffice.\nIf you do a good job, you should end with distinguible features, as show in the plot below.\n\n\nRSSIs may be a little noisy, mostly on the boundaries where weak networks may appear and disappear with a very low RSSI: this was not a problem for me, but if you're getting bad results you may filter out those low values.\n\n// replace\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n\n// with\n#define MIN_RSSI -90 // adjust to your needs\n\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i) > MIN_RSSI ? WiFi.RSSI(i) : 0;\n\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\n4.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use an accelerometer sensor to identify the gestures you play.\nThis is a remake of the project found on the Tensorflow blog. We're going to use a lot less powerful chip in this tutorial, tough: an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataRead the IMU sensorCalibrationDetect first motionRecord featuresTrain and export the SVM classifierSelect a suitable modelRun the inference\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the accelerations along the 3 axis (X, Y, Z) coming from an IMU to infer which gesture we're playing. We'll use a fixed number of recordings (NUM_SAMPLES) starting from the first detection of movement. \nThis means our feature vectors are going to be of dimension 3 * NUM_SAMPLES, which can become too large to fit in the memory of the Arduino Nano. We'll start with a low value for NUM_SAMPLES to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.\n2. Record sample data\n2.1 Read the IMU sensor\nFirst of all, we need to read the raw data from the IMU. This piece of code will be different based on the specific chip you use. To keep things consistent, we'll wrap the IMU logic in 2 functions: imu_setup and imu_read. \nI'll report a couple of example implementations for the MPU6050 and the MPU9250 (these are the chip I have at hand). You should save whichever code you use in a file called imu.h. \n#include "Wire.h"\n// library from https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050\n#include "MPU6050.h"\n#define OUTPUT_READABLE_ACCELGYRO\n\nMPU6050 imu;\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.initialize();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    float gx, gy, gz;\n\n    imu.getMotion6(&ax, &ay, &az, &gx, &gy, &gz);\n}\n#include "Wire.h"\n// library from https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250\n#include "MPU9250.h"\n\nMPU9250 imu(Wire, 0x68);\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.begin();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    imu.readSensor();\n\n    *ax = imu.getAccelX_mss();\n    *ay = imu.getAccelY_mss();\n    *az = imu.getAccelZ_mss();\n}\nIn the main .ino file, we dump the values to Serial monitor / plotter.\n#include "imu.h"\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 30\n#define NUM_AXES 3\n// sometimes you may get "spikes" in the readings\n// set a sensible value to truncate too large values\n#define TRUNCATE_AT 20\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    ay = constrain(ay, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    az = constrain(az, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n\n    Serial.print(ax);\n    Serial.print('\\t');\n    Serial.print(ay);\n    Serial.print('\\t');\n    Serial.println(az);\n}\nOpen the Serial plotter and make some movement to have an idea of the range of your readings.\n\n2.2 Calibration\nDue to gravity, we get a stable value of -9.8 on the Z axis at rest (you can see this in the previous image). Since I'd like to have almost 0 at rest, I created a super simple calibration procedure to remove this fixed offset from the readings.\ndouble baseline[NUM_AXES];\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n        delay(100);\n    }\n\n    baseline[0] = ax;\n    baseline[1] = ay;\n    baseline[2] = az;\n}\n\nMuch better.\n2.3 Detect first motion\nNow we need to check if motion is happening. To keep it simple, we'll use a naive approach that will look for an high value in the acceleration: if a threshold is exceeded, a gesture is starting. \nIf you did the calibration step, a threshold of 5 should work well. If you didn't calibrate, you have to come up with a value that suits your needs.\n#include imu.h\n\n#define ACCEL_THRESHOLD 5\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool motionDetected(float ax, float ay, float az) {\n    return (abs(ax) + abs(ay) + abs(az)) > ACCEL_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.4 Record features\nIf no motion is happening, we don't take any action and keep watching. If motion is happening, we print the next NUM_SAMPLES readings to Serial. \nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    recordIMU();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(2000);\n}\n\nvoid recordIMU() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        imu_read(&ax, &ay, &az);\n\n        ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 0] = ax;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 1] = ay;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 2] = az;\n\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nRecord 15-20 samples for each geasture and save them to a file, one for each gesture. Since we're dealing with highly dimensional data, you should collect as much samples as possible, to average out the noise.\n3.

Run the inference\n#include "model.h"\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (digitalRead(IN) == 0) {\n    recordButtonStatus();\n    Serial.print("Detected letter: ");\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  delay(10);\n}\nType some letter using the push button and see the identified value printed on the serial monitor.\nThat\u2019s it: you deployed machine learning in 2 Kb! \nProject figures\r\nOn my machine, the sketch targeted at the Arduino Nano (old generation) requires 12546 bytes (40%) of program space and 366 bytes (17%) of RAM. This means you could actually run machine learning in even less space than what the Arduino Nano provides. So, the answer to the question Can I run machine learning on Arduino? is definetly YES.\nDid you find this tutorial useful? Was is it easy to follow or did I miss something? Let me know in the comments so I can keep improving the blog.\n\r\nCheck the full project code on Github\nL'articolo Morse alphabet identification on Arduino with Machine learning proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",
