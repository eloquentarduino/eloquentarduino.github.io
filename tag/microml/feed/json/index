You will need to keep this data always with you, since it's required also during the inference</li>\n<li><code>y_train</code>: this array contains, for each training sample, the class it belongs to: 1 or -1</li>\n<li><code>linearKernel</code>: this is the kernel function for the SVM classifier (you can read more <a href=\"#\">here</a>). You can pass your own kernel other than linear (for example <code>poly</code> or <code>rbf</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this specific example, we're using the <code>RGB</code> class to handle the TCS3200 sensor reading, but this will change based on the dataset you want to train on. Also, since our features are going to be the R, G and B components of a color, <code>FEATURES_DIM</code> is set to 3.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">void setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    rgb.begin();\n\n    classifier.setC(5);\n    classifier.setTol(1e-5);\n    classifier.setMaxIter(10000);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The setup does not contain any logic really. You can use this part to configure the parameters of the classifier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>C</code>: &quot;The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points&quot; (quoted from <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/31066/what-is-the-influence-of-c-in-svms-with-linear-kernel\">stackexchange</a>)</li>\n<li><code>tol</code>: &quot;The tol parameter is a setting for the SVM's tolerance in optimization. Recall that <code>yi(xi.w+b)-1 &gt;= 0</code>. For an SVM to be valid, all values must be greater than or equal to 0, and at least one value on each side needs to be &quot;equal&quot; to 0, which will be your support vectors. Since it is highly unlikely that you will actually get values equal perfectly to 0, you set tolerance to allow a bit of wiggle room.&quot; (quoted from <a href=\"https://pythonprogramming.net/support-vector-machine-parameters-machine-learning-tutorial/\">pythonprogramming</a>)</li>\n<li><code>maxIter</code>: set an upper bound to the number of iterations the algorithm can take to converge</li>\n<li><code>passes</code>: max # of times to iterate over \u03b1\u2019s without changing</li>\n<li><code>alphaTol</code>: alfpha coefficients determine which samples from the training set are to be considered support vectors and so be included during the inference procedure.

Convolutional Neural Networks really shines in this task and can achieve almost perfect accuracy on many scenarios.\nSadly, you can't run CNN on your ESP32, they're just too large for a microcontroller.\nSince in this series about Machine Learning on Microcontrollers we're exploring the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at solving different classification tasks, we'll take a look into image classification too.\nTable of contentsWhat we're going to doFeatures definitionExtracting RGB componentsRecord samples imageTraining the classifierReal world exampleDisclaimer\nWhat we're going to do\nIn a previous post about color identification with Machine learning, we used an Arduino to detect the object we were pointing at with a color sensor (TCS3200) by its color: if we detected yellow, for example, we knew we had a banana in front of us.\nOf course such a process is not object recognition at all: yellow may be a banane, or a lemon, or an apple.\nObject inference, in that case, works only if you have exactly one object for a given color.\nThe objective of this post, instead, is to investigate if we can use the MicroML framework to do simple image recognition on the images from an ESP32 camera.\nThis is much more similar to the tasks you do on your PC with CNN or any other form of NN you are comfortable with. Sure, we will still apply some restrictions to fit the problem on a microcontroller, but this is a huge step forward compared to the simple color identification.\n\nIn this context, image recognition means deciding which class (from the trained ones) the current image belongs to.

Features definition</h2>\n<p>The microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WakeWord-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"from http://arduinolearning.com/code/ky038-microphone-module-and-arduino-example.php\" /></p>\n<p>When working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\">Fourier Transform</a>, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocrecord-sample-data\">2. Record sample data</h2>\n<p>First of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Raw-audio.gif\" alt=\"Raw audio stream\" /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"toctranslate-the-raw-values\">2.1 Translate the raw values</h3>\n<p>For the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. <code>analogRead()</code> is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">int16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) &gt;&gt; 2;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocdetect-sound\">2.2 Detect sound</h3>\n<p>As in the <a href=\"/2019/12/how-to-do-gesture-identification-on-arduino/\">tutorial about gesture classification</a>, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.</p>\n<p>To do this, we first record a &quot;background&quot; sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">float backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Background sound level is &quot;);\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>At this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) &gt;= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocrecord-the-words\">2.3 Record the words</h3>\n<p>As for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.<br />\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.</p>\n<p>I made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocfast-fourier-transform\">2.4 Fast Fourier Transform</h3>\n<p>Here we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</a>, which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. </p>\n<p>Luckily for us, there exists <a href=\"https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT\">a library</a> for Arduino that does FFT.</p>\n<p>And is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;arduinoFFT.h&gt;\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You don't need to know what the <code>Windowing</code> function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.</p>\n<p>At this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning tutorial we're going to use a microphone to identify the word you speak.\nThis is going to run on an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nIn this project the features are going to be the Fast Fourier Transform of 50 analog readings from a microphone, taken starting from when a loud sound is detected, sampled at intervals of 5 millis.\n\nThis tutorial is not about \"Wake word\" detection: it can't distinguish a known word from any other word. It can classify the word you speak among the ones you trained it to recognize!!!\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataTranslate the raw valuesDetect soundRecord the wordsFast Fourier TransformTrain and export the SVM classifierSelect a suitable modelRun the inference\n1. Features definition\nThe microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. \n\nWhen working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with Fourier Transform, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.\n2. Record sample data\nFirst of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.\n\n#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}\n2.1 Translate the raw values\nFor the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. analogRead() is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.\nint16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) &gt;&gt; 2;\n}\n2.2 Detect sound\nAs in the tutorial about gesture classification, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.\nTo do this, we first record a &quot;background&quot; sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.\nfloat backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Background sound level is &quot;);\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}\nAt this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.\n// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) &gt;= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.3 Record the words\nAs for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.\nI made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.\n\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n2.4 Fast Fourier Transform\nHere we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. \nLuckily for us, there exists a library for Arduino that does FFT.\nAnd is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!\n#include &lt;arduinoFFT.h&gt;\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}\nYou don't need to know what the Windowing function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.\nAt this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.\n\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it. You will lose some accuracy, but your model will be smaller.\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily.\nAudio is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\n2.5 Select a suitable model\nHere's an overview table of the 3 tests I did.\n\n\n\nKernel\nNo. support vectors\nAvg. accuracy\n\n\n\n\nLinear\n22\n87%\n\n\nPoly 3\n29\n91%\n\n\nRBF\n36\n94%\n\n\n\nOf course the one with the RBF kernel would be the most desiderable since it has a very high accuracy: 36 support vectors, tough, will produce a model too large to fit on an Arduino Nano.\nSo you're forced to pick the one with the highest accuracy that fit on your board: in my case it was the Linear kernel one.\n4. Run the inference\n#include &quot;model.h&quot;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    Serial.print(&quot;You said &quot;);\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n\n    delay(1000);\n}\nAnd that's it: word classification through machine learning on your Arduino board!

GPS works very well and with a very high accuracy (you can expect only a few meters of error).</p>\n<p>But it suffers a problem: it needs <em>Line of Sight</em> (a clear path from your device to the satellites). If you're not in an open place, like inside a building, you're out of luck.</p>\n<p>The task of detecting where you are when GPS localization is not an option is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_positioning_system\">indoor positioning</a>: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. </p>\n<p>There are lots of different approaches to this task (Wikipedia lists more than 10 of them), each with a varying level of commitment, difficulty, cost and accuracy.</p>\n<p>For this tutorial I opted for one that is both cost-efficient, easy to implement and readily available in most of the locations: <strong>WiFi indoor positioning</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocwhat-will-we-use-it-for\">What will we use it for?</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial about Machine learning on Arduino we're going to use Wifi indoor positioning to detect in which room of our house / office we are. This is the most basic task we can accomplish and will get us a feeling of level of accuracy we can achieve with such a simple setup.</p>\n<p>On this basis, we'll construct more sophisticated projects in future posts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocwhat-you-need\">What you need</h3>\n<p>To accomplish this tutorial, you really need 2 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a WiFi equipped board (ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino MKR WiFi 1010...)</li>\n<li>be in a place with a few WiFi networks around</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're doing this at home or in your office, there's a good change your neighbours have WiFi networks in their apartments you can leverage. If you live in an isolated contryside, sorry, this will not work for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tochow-it-works\">How it works</h3>\n<p>So, how exactly does Wifi indoor positioning works in conjuction with Machine learning? </p>\n<p>Let's pretend there are 5 different WiFi networks around you, like in the picture below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wifi1.png\" alt=\"Wifi indoor positioning example\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see there are two markers on the map: each of these markers will &quot;see&quot; different networks, with different <em>signal strengths</em> (a.k.a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication\">RSSI</a>).</p>\n<p>As you move around, those numbers will change: each room will be identified by the unique combination of the RSSIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocfeatures-definition\">1. Features definition</h2>\n<p>The features for this project are going to be the RSSIs (Received signal strength indication) of the known WiFi networks. If a network is out of range, it will have an RSSI equal to 0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocrecord-sample-data\">2. Record sample data</h2>\n<p>Before actually recording the sample data to train our classifier, we need to do some preliminary work. This is because not all networks will be visible all the time:  we have to work, however, with a fixed number of features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocenumerate-the-access-points\">2.1 Enumerate the access points</h3>\n<p>First of all we need to enumerate all the networks we will encounter during the inference process. </p>\n<p>To begin, we take a &quot;reconnaissance tour&quot; of the locations we want to predict and log all the networks we detect. Load the following sketch and take note of all the networks that appear on the Serial monitor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;WiFi.h&gt;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n      Serial.println(WiFi.SSID(i));\n\n  delay(3000);\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"toccreate-an-access-point-array\">2.2 Create an access point array</h3>\n<p>Now that we have a bunch of SSIDs, we need to assign each SSID to a fixed index, from 0 to <code>MAX_NETWORKS</code>.</p>\n<p>You can implement this part as you like, but in this demo I'll make use of a class I wrote called <code>Array</code> (you can see the <a href=\"https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentArduino/blob/master/src/data_structures/Array.h\">source code</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agrimagsrl/eloquentarduino/blob/master/examples/ArrayExample/ArrayExample.ino\">example</a> on Github), which implements 2 useful functions: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>push()</code> to add an element to the array</li>\n<li><code>indexOf()</code> to get the index of an element.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See <a href=\"/2019/12/how-to-install-the-eloquent-library/\">how to install the Eloquent library</a> if you don't have it already installed.<br />\nAt this point we populate the array with all the networks we saved from the reconnaissance tour.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;eDataStructures.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_NETWORKS 10\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::DataStructures;\n\ndouble features[MAX_NETWORKS];\nArray&lt;String, MAX_NETWORKS&gt; knownNetworks(&quot;&quot;);\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #0&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #1&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #2&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #3&quot;);\n    // and so on\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocconvert-to-features-vector\">2.3 Convert to features vector</h3>\n<p>The second step is to convert the scan results into a features vector.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use the nearby WiFi access points to locate where we are. For this project to work you will need a Wifi equipped board, such as ESP8266 or ESP32.\n\n\nTable of contentsWhat is indoor positioning?What will we use it for?What you needHow it worksFeatures definitionRecord sample dataEnumerate the access pointsCreate an access point arrayConvert to features vectorTrain and export the SVM classifierRun the inference\nWhat is indoor positioning?\nWe all are used to GPS positioning: our device will use satellites to track our position on Earth. GPS works very well and with a very high accuracy (you can expect only a few meters of error).\nBut it suffers a problem: it needs Line of Sight (a clear path from your device to the satellites). If you're not in an open place, like inside a building, you're out of luck.\nThe task of detecting where you are when GPS localization is not an option is called indoor positioning: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. \nThere are lots of different approaches to this task (Wikipedia lists more than 10 of them), each with a varying level of commitment, difficulty, cost and accuracy.\nFor this tutorial I opted for one that is both cost-efficient, easy to implement and readily available in most of the locations: WiFi indoor positioning.\nWhat will we use it for?\nIn this tutorial about Machine learning on Arduino we're going to use Wifi indoor positioning to detect in which room of our house / office we are. This is the most basic task we can accomplish and will get us a feeling of level of accuracy we can achieve with such a simple setup.\nOn this basis, we'll construct more sophisticated projects in future posts.\nWhat you need\nTo accomplish this tutorial, you really need 2 things:\n\na WiFi equipped board (ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino MKR WiFi 1010...)\nbe in a place with a few WiFi networks around\n\nIf you're doing this at home or in your office, there's a good change your neighbours have WiFi networks in their apartments you can leverage. If you live in an isolated contryside, sorry, this will not work for you.\nHow it works\nSo, how exactly does Wifi indoor positioning works in conjuction with Machine learning? \nLet's pretend there are 5 different WiFi networks around you, like in the picture below.\n\nAs you can see there are two markers on the map: each of these markers will &quot;see&quot; different networks, with different signal strengths (a.k.a RSSI).\nAs you move around, those numbers will change: each room will be identified by the unique combination of the RSSIs.\n1. Features definition\nThe features for this project are going to be the RSSIs (Received signal strength indication) of the known WiFi networks. If a network is out of range, it will have an RSSI equal to 0.\n2. Record sample data\nBefore actually recording the sample data to train our classifier, we need to do some preliminary work. This is because not all networks will be visible all the time:  we have to work, however, with a fixed number of features.\n2.1 Enumerate the access points\nFirst of all we need to enumerate all the networks we will encounter during the inference process. \nTo begin, we take a &quot;reconnaissance tour&quot; of the locations we want to predict and log all the networks we detect. Load the following sketch and take note of all the networks that appear on the Serial monitor.\n#include &lt;WiFi.h&gt;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n      Serial.println(WiFi.SSID(i));\n\n  delay(3000);\n}\n2.2 Create an access point array\nNow that we have a bunch of SSIDs, we need to assign each SSID to a fixed index, from 0 to MAX_NETWORKS.\nYou can implement this part as you like, but in this demo I'll make use of a class I wrote called Array (you can see the source code and example on Github), which implements 2 useful functions: \n\npush() to add an element to the array\nindexOf() to get the index of an element.\n\nSee how to install the Eloquent library if you don't have it already installed.\nAt this point we populate the array with all the networks we saved from the reconnaissance tour.\n#include &lt;eDataStructures.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_NETWORKS 10\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::DataStructures;\n\ndouble features[MAX_NETWORKS];\nArray&lt;String, MAX_NETWORKS&gt; knownNetworks(&quot;&quot;);\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n    WiFi.disconnect();\n\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #0&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #1&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #2&quot;);\n    knownNetworks.push(&quot;SSID #3&quot;);\n    // and so on\n}\n2.3 Convert to features vector\nThe second step is to convert the scan results into a features vector. Each feature will be the RSSI of the given SSID, in the exact order we populated the knownNetworks array.\nIn practice:\nfeatures[0] == RSSI of SSID #0;\nfeatures[1] == RSSI of SSID #1;\nfeatures[2] == RSSI of SSID #2;\nfeatures[3] == RSSI of SSID #3;\n// and so on\nThe code below will do the job.\nvoid loop() {\n    scan();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid scan() {\n    int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n    resetFeatures();\n\n    // assign RSSIs to feature vector\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n        String ssid = WiFi.SSID(i);\n        uint16_t networkIndex = knownNetworks.indexOf(ssid);\n\n        // only create feature if the current SSID is a known one\n        if (!isnan(networkIndex))\n            features[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n    }\n}\n\n// reset all features to 0\nvoid resetFeatures() {\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatues; i++)\n        features[i] = 0;\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nGrab some recordings just staying in a location for a few seconds and save the serial output to a file; then move to the next location and repeat: 10-15 samples for each location will suffice.\nIf you do a good job, you should end with distinguible features, as show in the plot below.\n\n\nRSSIs may be a little noisy, mostly on the boundaries where weak networks may appear and disappear with a very low RSSI: this was not a problem for me, but if you're getting bad results you may filter out those low values.\n\n// replace\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n\n// with\n#define MIN_RSSI -90 // adjust to your needs\n\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i) > MIN_RSSI ? WiFi.RSSI(i) : 0;\n\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\n4.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use an accelerometer sensor to identify the gestures you play.\nThis is a remake of the project found on the Tensorflow blog. We're going to use a lot less powerful chip in this tutorial, tough: an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataRead the IMU sensorCalibrationDetect first motionRecord featuresTrain and export the SVM classifierSelect a suitable modelRun the inference\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the accelerations along the 3 axis (X, Y, Z) coming from an IMU to infer which gesture we're playing. We'll use a fixed number of recordings (NUM_SAMPLES) starting from the first detection of movement. \nThis means our feature vectors are going to be of dimension 3 * NUM_SAMPLES, which can become too large to fit in the memory of the Arduino Nano. We'll start with a low value for NUM_SAMPLES to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.\n2. Record sample data\n2.1 Read the IMU sensor\nFirst of all, we need to read the raw data from the IMU. This piece of code will be different based on the specific chip you use. To keep things consistent, we'll wrap the IMU logic in 2 functions: imu_setup and imu_read. \nI'll report a couple of example implementations for the MPU6050 and the MPU9250 (these are the chip I have at hand). You should save whichever code you use in a file called imu.h. \n#include &quot;Wire.h&quot;\n// library from https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050\n#include &quot;MPU6050.h&quot;\n#define OUTPUT_READABLE_ACCELGYRO\n\nMPU6050 imu;\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.initialize();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    float gx, gy, gz;\n\n    imu.getMotion6(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az, &amp;gx, &amp;gy, &amp;gz);\n}\n#include &quot;Wire.h&quot;\n// library from https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250\n#include &quot;MPU9250.h&quot;\n\nMPU9250 imu(Wire, 0x68);\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.begin();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    imu.readSensor();\n\n    *ax = imu.getAccelX_mss();\n    *ay = imu.getAccelY_mss();\n    *az = imu.getAccelZ_mss();\n}\nIn the main .ino file, we dump the values to Serial monitor / plotter.\n#include &quot;imu.h&quot;\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 30\n#define NUM_AXES 3\n// sometimes you may get &quot;spikes&quot; in the readings\n// set a sensible value to truncate too large values\n#define TRUNCATE_AT 20\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    ay = constrain(ay, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    az = constrain(az, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n\n    Serial.print(ax);\n    Serial.print(&#039;\\t&#039;);\n    Serial.print(ay);\n    Serial.print(&#039;\\t&#039;);\n    Serial.println(az);\n}\nOpen the Serial plotter and make some movement to have an idea of the range of your readings.\n\n2.2 Calibration\nDue to gravity, we get a stable value of -9.8 on the Z axis at rest (you can see this in the previous image). Since I'd like to have almost 0 at rest, I created a super simple calibration procedure to remove this fixed offset from the readings.\ndouble baseline[NUM_AXES];\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n        delay(100);\n    }\n\n    baseline[0] = ax;\n    baseline[1] = ay;\n    baseline[2] = az;\n}\n\nMuch better.\n2.3 Detect first motion\nNow we need to check if motion is happening. To keep it simple, we'll use a naive approach that will look for an high value in the acceleration: if a threshold is exceeded, a gesture is starting. \nIf you did the calibration step, a threshold of 5 should work well. If you didn't calibrate, you have to come up with a value that suits your needs.\n#include imu.h\n\n#define ACCEL_THRESHOLD 5\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool motionDetected(float ax, float ay, float az) {\n    return (abs(ax) + abs(ay) + abs(az)) &gt; ACCEL_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.4 Record features\nIf no motion is happening, we don't take any action and keep watching. If motion is happening, we print the next NUM_SAMPLES readings to Serial. \nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    recordIMU();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(2000);\n}\n\nvoid recordIMU() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n        ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 0] = ax;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 1] = ay;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 2] = az;\n\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? 'n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nRecord 15-20 samples for each geasture and save them to a file, one for each gesture. Since we're dealing with highly dimensional data, you should collect as much samples as possible, to average out the noise.\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning, differently from the previous and simpler ones, we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily. Motion is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Select a suitable model\nNow that we selected the best model, we have to export it to C code. Here comes the culprit: not all models will fit on your board.\nThe core of SVM (Support Vector Machines) are support vectors: each trained classifier will be characterized by a certain number of them. The problem is: if there're too much, the generated code will be too large to fit in your flash.\nFor this reason, instead of selecting the best model on accuracy, you should make a ranking, from the best performing to the worst. For each model, starting from the top, you should import it in your Arduino project and try to compile: if it fits, fine, you're done. Otherwise you should pick the next and try again.\nIt may seem a tedious process, but keep in mind that we're trying to infer a class from 90 features in 2 Kb of RAM and 32 Kb of flash: I think this is an acceptable tradeoff.\nWe&#039;re fitting a model to infer a class from 90 features in 2 Kb of RAM and 32 Kb of flash!Click To Tweet\nI'll report a few figures for different combinations I tested.\n\n\n\nKernel\nC\nGamma\nDegree\nVectors\nFlash size\nRAM (b)\nAvg accuracy\n\n\n\n\nRBF\n10\n0.001\n-\n37\n53 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n2\n12\n25 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n3\n25\n40 Kb\n1228\n97%\n\n\nLinear\n50\n-\n1\n40\n55 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\nRBF\n100\n0.01\n-\n61\n80 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we achieved a very high accuracy on the test set for all the classifiers: only one, though, fitted on the Arduino Nano. Of course, if you use a larger board, you can deploy the others too.\nAs a side note, take a look at the RAM column: all the values are equal: this is because in the implementation is independant from the number of support vectors and only depends on the number of features.\n4.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to identify the letters from the Morse alphabet.\nIn practice, we'll translate dots (\u2022) and dashes (\u2012)  &quot;typed&quot; with a push button into meaningful characters.\nIn this tutorial we're going to target an Arduino Nano board (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataTrain and export the SVM classifierRun the inference\n1. Features definition\nFor our task we'll use a simple push button as input and a fixed number of samples taken at a fixed interval (100 ms), starting from the first detection of the button press. I chose to record 30 samples for each letter, but you can easily customize the value as per your needs. \nWith 30 samples at 100 ms frequency, we'll have 3 seconds to &quot;type&quot; the letter and on the Serial monitor will appear a sequence of 0s and 1s, representing if the button was pressed or not; the inference procedure will translate this sequence into a letter.\nAs a reference, here are a couple example of what we'll be working with.\n// A (\u2022\u2012)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// D (\u2012\u2022\u2022)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// E (\u2022)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n2. Record sample data\nTo the bare minimum, we'll need a push button and two wires: one to ground and the other to a digital pin. Since in the example we'll make the button an INPUT_PULLUP, we'll read 0 when the button is pressed and 1 when not.  \n\nAll we need to do is detect a press and record the following 30 samples of the digital pin:\n#define IN 4\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 30\n#define INTERVAL 100\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  pinMode(IN, INPUT_PULLUP);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (digitalRead(IN) == 0) {\n    recordButtonStatus();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  delay(10);\n}\n\nvoid recordButtonStatus() {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n    features[i] = digitalRead(IN);\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n  } \n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ?
