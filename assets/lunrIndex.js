Now it is time to upgrade your toolbelt with a new item: One-vs-One multiclass classifier.\n\nOne vs One\nMany classifiers are, by nature, binary: they can only distinguish the positive class from the negative one. Many of real-world problems, however, are multiclass: you have 3 or more possible outcomes to distinguish from.\nThere are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n\nOne vs All: if your classifier is able to output a confidence score of its prediction, for N classes you train N classifiers, each able to recognize a single class. During inference, you pick the &quot;most confident&quot; one.\nOne vs One: for N classes, you train N * (N-1) / 2 classifiers, one for each couple of classes. During inference, each classifier makes a prediction and you pick the class with the highest number of votes.\n\nSince SGD and Passive-Aggressive don't output a confidence score, I implemented the One vs One algorithm to tackle the multiclass classification problem on microcontrollers.\nActually, One vs One is not a new type of classifier: it is really a &quot;coordinator&quot; class that sorts which samples go to which classifier. You can still choose your own classifier type to use.\nAs SGD and Passive-Aggressive, OneVsOne implements the classifier interface, so you will use the well known fitOne and predict methods.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nExample code\n// Esp32 has some problems with min/max\n#define min(a, b) (a) &lt; (b) ?

This saves you critical memory on tiny devices while still achieving top performance! Now you can use it on your microcontroller with ease.\n\nA brief recap on Stochastic Gradient Descent\nIf you ever worked with Machine learning, you surely know about Gradient descent: it is an iterative algorithm to optimize a loss function. \nIt is much general-purpose, in the sense that it is not bound to a particular application, but it has been heavily used in Neural networks in the recent years.\nYet, it can be used as a classifier on its own if you set its loss function as the classification error.\n\nThis is the core update rule of Gradient descent: quite simple.\nAs you see, there's a summation in the formula: this means we need to cycle through the entire training set to compute the update to the weights.\nIn case of large datasets, this can be slow or not possible at all.\nAnd requires a lot of memory.\nAnd we don't have memory on microcontrollers.\nSo we need Stochastic gradient descent.\nStochastic gradient descent has the same exact update rule, but it is applied on the single training sample.\nImagine the summation goes from 1 to 1, instead of m.\nThat's it.\n\nHow to use\nThe pattern of use is similar to that of the Passive Aggressive classifier: you have the fitOne and predict methods.\nFirst of all, download the library from Github.\n#include &lt;EloquentSGD.h&gt;\n#include &lt;EloquentAccuracyScorer.h&gt;\n#include &quot;iris.h&quot;\n\n#define VERBOSE\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    int trainSamples;\n    int retrainingCycles;\n    SGD&lt;FEATURES_DIM&gt; clf;\n    AccuracyScorer scorer;\n\n    // ....\n\n    // train\n    for (uint16_t cycle = 0; cycle &lt; retrainingCycles; cycle++)\n        for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; trainSamples; i++)\n            clf.fitOne(X[i], y[i","tags":"microml online-learning Arduino Machine learning"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/04/passive-aggressive-classifier-for-embedded-devices/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/04/passive-aggressive-classifier-for-embedded-devices/","title":"Passive-aggressive classifier for embedded devices","summary":"When working with memory constrained devices you may not able to keep all the training data in memory: passive-aggressive classifiers may help solve your memory problems.\n\nBatch learning\nA couple weeks ago I started exploring the possibility to train a machine learning classifier directly on a microcontroller. Since I like SVM, I ported the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm to plain C, ready to be deployed to embedded devices.\nNow, that kind of algorithm works in the so-called &quot;batch-mode&quot;: it needs all the training data to be available in memory to learn.\nThis may be a limiting factor on resource-constrained devices, since it poses an upper bound to the number of samples you can train on. And when working with high-dimensional datasets, the number of samples could be not enough to achieve good accuracy.\nEnter incremental learning\nTo solve this limitation, you need a totally different kind of learning algorithms: you need incremental (a.k.a online a.k.a out of core) learning.\nIncremental learning works by inspecting one training sample at a time, instead of all at once.\nThe clear advantage is that you have a tiny memory footprint. And this is a huge advantage.\nThe clear disadvantage is that you don't have the &quot;big picture&quot; of your data, so:\n\nthe end result will probably be affected by the order of presentation of the samples\nyou may not be able to achieve top accuracy\n\nPassive-aggressive classifier\nPassive-aggressive classification is one of the available incremental learning algorithms and it is very simple to implement, since it has a closed-form update rule.\nPlease refer to this short explanation on Passive-aggressive classifiers for a nice description with images.\nThe core concept is that the classifier adjusts it weight vector for each mis-classified training sample it receives, trying to get it correct.\n\nBenchmarks\nI run a couple benchmark on my Esp32 to assess both accuracy and training time.\nFirst of all: it i","tags":"microml online-learning Arduino Machine learning"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/03/how-to-train-a-color-classification-machine-learning-classifier-directly-on-your-arduino-board/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/03/how-to-train-a-color-classification-machine-learning-classifier-directly-on-your-arduino-board/","title":"How to train a color classification Machine learning classifier directly on your Arduino board","summary":"In the previous post we learnt it is possible to train a Machine learning classifier directly on a microcontroller.

What if you could train a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?\n\n\nWhen I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.\nAs simple as this.\nTraining is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.\nMoreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.\nAnd this yield true until now.\nUntil my reader Joao Carvalho, in the comments on the post about an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. \nIn the past I replied &quot;No way&quot; to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a Javascript implementation of the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm.\nAt a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.\nAnd in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.\nThen I deployed it to my ESP32 and... it worked!\nMy first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.\nBut I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.\nExecution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.\nThe results are summarized in the following table and plots.\n\n\n\nFeatures size\nTraining size\nTraining time (ms)\nUnit inference time (ms)\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n4\n10\n0\n0,011\n80","tags":"microml Arduino Machine learning Programming"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/easy-arduino-thermal-camera-with-ascii-video-streaming/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/easy-arduino-thermal-camera-with-ascii-video-streaming/","title":"Easy Arduino thermal camera with (ASCII) video streaming","summary":"Ever wanted to use your thermal camera with Arduino but found it difficult to go beyond the tutorials code?
