Let's see the easiest possible way to view your thermal camera streaming without an LCD display!\n\n\nMLX90640 eloquent library\nAs you may know if you read my previous posts, I strongly believe in &quot;eloquent&quot; code, that is code that's as easy as possible to read.\nHow many lines do you think you need to read a MLX90640 camera? Well, not that much in fact.\n#include &quot;EloquentMLX90640.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Sensors;\n\nfloat buffer[768];\nMLX90640 camera;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  if (!camera.begin()) {\n    Serial.println(&quot;Init error&quot;);\n    delay(50000);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  camera.read(buffer);\n  delay(3000);\n}\nIf you skip the declaration lines, you only need a begin() and read() call.\nThat's it.\nWhat begin() does is to run all of the boilerplate code I mentioned earlier (checking the connection and initializing the parameters).\nread() populates the buffer you pass as argument with the temperature readings.\nFrom now on, you're free to handle that array as you may like: this is the most flexible way for the library to handle any use-case. It simply does not pose any restriction.\nYou can find the camera code at the end of the page or on Github.\nPrinting as ASCII Art\nNow that you have this data, you may want to actually &quot;view&quot; it. Well, that's not an easy task as one may hope.\nYou will need an LCD if you want to create a standalone product. If you have one, it'll be the best, it's a really cute project to build.\nHere's a video from Adafruit that showcases even a 3D-printed case.\n\nIf you don't have an LCD, though, it is less practical to access your image.\nI did this in the past, and it meant creating a Python script reading the serial port every second and updating a plot.\nIt works, sure, but it's not the most convenient way to handle it.\nThis is the reason I thought about ASCII art: it is used to draw image","tags":"Computer vision Electronics Eloquent library"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/handwritten-digit-classification-with-arduino-and-microml/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/handwritten-digit-classification-with-arduino-and-microml/","title":"Handwritten digit classification with Arduino and MicroML","summary":"We continue exploring the endless possibilities on the MicroML (Machine Learning for Microcontrollers) framework on Arduino and ESP32 boards: in this post we're back to image classification. In particular, we'll distinguish handwritten digits using an ESP32 camera.\n\n\nIf this is the first time you're reading my blog, you may have missed that I'm on a journey to push the limits of Machine learning on embedded devices like the Arduino boards and ESP32.\nI started with accelerometer data classification, then did Wifi indoor positioning as a proof of concept.\nIn the last weeks, though, I undertook a more difficult path that is image classification.\nImage classification is where Convolutional Neural Networks really shine, but I'm here to question this settlement and demostrate that it is possible to come up with much lighter alternatives.\nIn this post we continue with the examples, replicating a &quot;benchmark&quot; dataset in Machine learning: the handwritten digits classification.\n\nIf you are curious about a specific image classification task you would like to see implemented, let me know in the comments: I'm always open to new ideas\n\nThe task\nThe objective of this example is to be able to tell what an handwritten digit is, taking as input a photo from the ESP32 camera.\nIn particular, we have 3 handwritten numbers and the task of our model will be to distinguish which image is what number.\n\nI only have a single image per digit, but you're free to draw as many samples as you like: it should help improve the performance of you're classifier.\n1. Feature extraction\nWhen dealing with images, if you use a CNN this step is often overlooked: CNNs are made on purpose to handle raw pixel values, so you just throw the image in and it is handled properly.\nWhen using other types of classifiers, it could help add a bit of feature engineering to help the classifier doing its job and achieve high accuracy.\nBut not this time.\nI wanted to be as &quot;light&quot; as possible in this demo,","tags":"camera esp32 microml Arduino Machine learning Computer vision"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/even-smaller-machine-learning-models-for-your-mcu/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/even-smaller-machine-learning-models-for-your-mcu/","title":"Even smaller Machine learning models for your MCU: up to -82% code size","summary":"So far we've used SVM (Support Vector Machine) as our main classifier to port a Machine learning model to a microcontroller: but recently I found an interesting alternative which could be waaaay smaller, mantaining a similar accuracy.\n\n\nTable of contentsThe current stateA new algorithm: Relevance Vector MachinesTraining a classifierPorting to CPerformace comparisonSize comparisonDisclaimer\nThe current state\nI chose SVM as my main focus of intereset for the MicroML framework because I knew the support vector encoding could be very memory efficient once ported to plain C.

Image recognition with ESP32 and Arduino","summary":"Do you have an ESP32 camera? \nWant to do image recognition directly on your ESP32, without a PC?\nIn this post we'll look into a very basic image recognition task: distinguish apples from oranges with machine learning.\n\n\nImage recognition is a very hot topic these days in the AI/ML landscape. Convolutional Neural Networks really shines in this task and can achieve almost perfect accuracy on many scenarios.\nSadly, you can't run CNN on your ESP32, they're just too large for a microcontroller.\nSince in this series about Machine Learning on Microcontrollers we're exploring the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at solving different classification tasks, we'll take a look into image classification too.\nTable of contentsWhat we're going to doFeatures definitionExtracting RGB componentsRecord samples imageTraining the classifierReal world exampleDisclaimer\nWhat we're going to do\nIn a previous post about color identification with Machine learning, we used an Arduino to detect the object we were pointing at with a color sensor (TCS3200) by its color: if we detected yellow, for example, we knew we had a banana in front of us.\nOf course such a process is not object recognition at all: yellow may be a banane, or a lemon, or an apple.\nObject inference, in that case, works only if you have exactly one object for a given color.\nThe objective of this post, instead, is to investigate if we can use the MicroML framework to do simple image recognition on the images from an ESP32 camera.\nThis is much more similar to the tasks you do on your PC with CNN or any other form of NN you are comfortable with. Sure, we will still apply some restrictions to fit the problem on a microcontroller, but this is a huge step forward compared to the simple color identification.\n\nIn this context, image recognition means deciding which class (from the trained ones) the current image belongs to.

External hardware\nFirst of all, you need external hardware. If you're using a breadboard, no problem, you just need a couple more wires and you're good to go. But I have a nice M5stick camera (no affiliate link), that's already well packaged, so it won't be that easy to add a PIR sensor.\n2. Field of View\nPIR sensors have a limited FOV (field of view), so you will need more than one to cover the whole range of the camera. \nMy camera, for example, has fish-eye lens which give me 160° of view. Most cheap PIR sensors have a 120° field of view, so one will not suffice. This adds even more space to my project.\n3.
