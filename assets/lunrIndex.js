I mean, that board has only 32 Kb of program space and 2 Kb of RAM and you can buy a chinese clone for around 2.50 $.\nIt already opened the path to a embedded machine learning at a new scale, given the huge amount of microcontrollers ready to become &quot;intelligent&quot;. \nBut it was not enough for me: after all, the MicroML generator exports plain C that should run on any embedded system, not only on Arduino boards.\nSo I setup to test if I could go even smaller and run it on the #1 of tiny chips: the Attiny85.\nMicroML exports plain C that could run anywhere, not only on Arduino boards.Click To Tweet\nNo, I couldn't.\nThe generated code makes use of a variadic function, which seems to not be supported by the Attiny compiler in the Arduino IDE.\nSo I had to come up with an alternative implementation to make it work.\nFortunately I already experimented with a non-variadic version when first writing the porter, so it was a matter of refreshing that algorithm and try it out.\nGuess what? It compiled!\nSo I tried porting one my earliear tutorial (the color identification one) to the Attiny and...\nBoom! Machine learning on an Attiny85!Click To Tweet\nHere's a step-by-step tutorial on how you can do it too.\n\nI strongly suggest you read the original tutorial before following this one, because I won't go into too much details on the common steps here.\n\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionRecord sample dataTrain and export the SVM classifierRun the inferenceProject figures\n1.

GPS works very well and with a very high accuracy (you can expect only a few meters of error).\nBut it suffers a problem: it needs Line of Sight (a clear path from your device to the satellites). If you're not in an open place, like inside a building, you're out of luck.\nThe task of detecting where you are when GPS localization is not an option is called indoor positioning: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. \nThere are lots of different approaches to this task (Wikipedia lists more than 10 of them), each with a varying level of commitment, difficulty, cost and accuracy.\nFor this tutorial I opted for one that is both cost-efficient, easy to implement and readily available in most of the locations: WiFi indoor positioning.\nWhat will we use it for?\nIn this tutorial about Machine learning on Arduino we're going to use Wifi indoor positioning to detect in which room of our house / office we are.

Features definition\nWe're going to use the accelerations along the 3 axis (X, Y, Z) coming from an IMU to infer which gesture we're playing. We'll use a fixed number of recordings (NUM_SAMPLES) starting from the first detection of movement. \nThis means our feature vectors are going to be of dimension 3 * NUM_SAMPLES, which can become too large to fit in the memory of the Arduino Nano. We'll start with a low value for NUM_SAMPLES to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.\n2.

To keep things consistent, we'll wrap the IMU logic in 2 functions: imu_setup and imu_read. \nI'll report a couple of example implementations for the MPU6050 and the MPU9250 (these are the chip I have at hand).
