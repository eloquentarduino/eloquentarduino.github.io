What if you could train a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?\n\n\nWhen I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.\nAs simple as this.\nTraining is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.\nMoreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.\nAnd this yield true until now.\nUntil my reader Joao Carvalho, in the comments on the post about an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. \nIn the past I replied &quot;No way&quot; to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a Javascript implementation of the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm.\nAt a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.\nAnd in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.\nThen I deployed it to my ESP32 and... it worked!\nMy first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.\nBut I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.\nExecution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.\nThe results are summarized in the following table and plots.\n\n\n\nFeatures size\nTraining size\nTraining time (ms)\nUnit inference time (ms)\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n4\n10\n0\n0,011\n80","tags":"microml Arduino Machine learning Programming"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/easy-arduino-thermal-camera-with-ascii-video-streaming/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/02/easy-arduino-thermal-camera-with-ascii-video-streaming/","title":"Easy Arduino thermal camera with (ASCII) video streaming","summary":"Ever wanted to use your thermal camera with Arduino but found it difficult to go beyond the tutorials code?

External hardware\nFirst of all, you need external hardware. If you're using a breadboard, no problem, you just need a couple more wires and you're good to go. But I have a nice M5stick camera (no affiliate link), that's already well packaged, so it won't be that easy to add a PIR sensor.\n2.
