Machine learning on Attiny85: Color identification tutorial","summary":"You won't believe it, but you can run Machine learning on an Attiny85 (and many others Attiny). Not that you should, but you can. In this post I'll show you how!\n\n\nWhen I first run a Machine learning project on my Arduino Nano (old generation), it already felt a big achievement. I mean, that board has only 32 Kb of program space and 2 Kb of RAM and you can buy a chinese clone for around 2.50 $.\nIt already opened the path to a huge amount of microcontrollers ready to become &quot;intelligent&quot;. \nBut it was not enough for me: after all, the MicroML generator exports plain C that should run anywhere, not only on Arduino boards.\nSo I setup to test if I could go even smaller and run it on the #1 of tiny chips: the Attiny85.\nMicroML exports plain C that could run anywhere, not only on Arduino boards.Click To Tweet\nNo, I couldn't.\nThe generated code makes use of a variadic function, which seems to not be supported by the Attiny compiler in the Arduino IDE.\nSo I had to come up with an alternative implementation to make it work.\nFortunately I already experimented with a non-variadic version when first writing the porter, so it was a matter of refreshing that algorithm and try it out.\nGuess what? It compiled!\nSo I tried porting one my earliear tutorial (the color identification one) to the Attiny and...\nBoom! Machine learning on an Attiny85!Click To Tweet\nSo, here's a step-by-step tutorial on how you can do it too.\n\nI strongly suggest you read the original tutorial before following this one, because I won't go into too much details on the common steps here.\n\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the RGB components of a color sensor (TCS3200 in my case) to infer which object we're pointing it at. This means our features are going to be 3-dimensional, which leads to a really simple model with very high accuracy.\n\nThe Attiny85 has 8 Kb of flash and 512 bytes of RAM, so you won't be able to load any model that uses more than a few features (probably less than 10).\n\n2.

It can classify the word you speak among the ones you trained it to recognize!!!\n\n1. Features definition\nThe microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. \n\nWhen working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with Fourier Transform, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.\n2. Record sample data\nFirst of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.\n\n#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}\n2.1 Translate the raw values\nFor the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. analogRead() is returning only positive values, tough, ","tags":"Arduino Machine learning"},"http://eloquent.blog/2019/12/wifi-indoor-positioning-on-arduino/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2019/12/wifi-indoor-positioning-on-arduino/","title":"Indoor positioning using Arduino and Machine Learning in 4 steps","summary":"In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use the nearby WiFi access points to locate where we are. For this project to work you will need a Wifi equipped board, such as ESP8266 or ESP32.\n\n\nThe task of detecting where you are when GPS or satellite localization is not an option is called indoor positioning: it could be in a building, an airport, a parking garage. I opted for WiFi because it is widely available, but the same project could be re-purposed to use Bluetooth, if there are enough devices in your location.\nThis tutorial is part of a series of tutorials about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:\r\n\r\n  define the features\r\n  record sample data: run a few scans for each location to be predicted and record the RSSI (signal strength) of each visible network\r\n train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using micromlgen\r\n copy and paste the generated code in a model.h file in the Arduino project and call predict() from it\r\n\n1.

If a network is out of range, it will have an RSSI equal to 0.\n2. Record sample data\n2.1 Enumerate the access points\nFirst of all we need to enumerate all the networks we will encounter during the inference process. This is because not all networks will be visible all the time:  we have to work, however, with a fixed number of features.\nTo begin, we take a &quot;reconnaissance tour&quot; of the locations we want to predict and log all the networks we detect.

We'll start with a low value for NUM_SAMPLES to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.\n2.

To keep things consistent, we'll wrap the IMU logic in 2 functions: imu_setup and imu_read. \nI'll report a couple of example implementations for the MPU6050 and the MPU9250 (these are the chip I have at hand).
