They uncover every single aspect you may encounter during your first steps and give a very sound introduction to the general topic of training, validating and testing a dataset on a model.\nIf I will go on with this TinyML stuff, I'll probably buy a copy: I strongly recommend you to at least read the free sample.\nOnce done reading the 6 chapters, I wanted to try the described tutorial on my ESP32. Sadly, it is not mentioned in the supported boards on the book, so I had to solve it by myself.\nIn this post I'm going to make a sort of recap of my learnings about the steps you need to follow to implement TF models to a microcontroller and introduce you to a tiny library I wrote for the purpose of facilitating the deployment in the Arduino IDE: EloquentTinyML.\nBuilding our first model\nFirst of all, we need a model to deploy.\nThe book guides us on building a neural network capable of predicting the sine value of a given number, in the range from 0 to Pi (3.14).\nIt's an easy model to get started (the &quot;Hello world&quot; of machine learning, according to the authors), so we'll stick with it.\nI won't go into too much details about generating data and training the classifier, because I suppose you already know that part if you want to port Tensorflow on a microcontroller.\nHere's the code from the book.\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\n\ndef get_mod","tags":"Arduino Machine learning"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/01/image-recognition-with-esp32-and-arduino/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/01/image-recognition-with-esp32-and-arduino/","title":"Apple or Orange? Image recognition with ESP32 and Arduino","summary":"Do you have an ESP32 camera? \nWant to do image recognition directly on your ESP32, without a PC?\nIn this post we'll look into a very basic image recognition task: distinguish apples from oranges with machine learning.\n\n\nImage recognition is a very hot topic these days in the AI/ML landscape. Convolutional Neural Networks really shines in this task and can achieve almost perfect accuracy on many scenarios.\nSadly, you can't run CNN on your ESP32, they're just too large for a microcontroller.\nSince in this series about Machine Learning on Microcontrollers we're exploring the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at solving different classification tasks, we'll take a look into image classification too.\nTable of contentsWhat we're going to doFeatures definitionExtracting RGB componentsRecord samples imageTraining the classifierReal world exampleDisclaimer\nWhat we're going to do\nIn a previous post about color identification with Machine learning, we used an Arduino to detect the object we were pointing at with a color sensor (TCS3200) by its color: if we detected yellow, for example, we knew we had a banana in front of us.\nOf course such a process is not object recognition at all: yellow may be a banane, or a lemon, or an apple.\nObject inference, in that case, works only if you have exactly one object for a given color.\nThe objective of this post, instead, is to investigate if we can use the MicroML framework to do simple image recognition on the images from an ESP32 camera.\nThis is much more similar to the tasks you do on your PC with CNN or any other form of NN you are comfortable with. Sure, we will still apply some restrictions to fit the problem on a microcontroller, but this is a huge step forward compared to the simple color identification.\n\nIn this context, image recognition means deciding which class (from the trained ones) the current image belongs to.

We will analyze video stream in (almost) real-time and compare frame by frame: if lots of pixels changed, we'll call it motion.\nCan't I use an external PIR?\nSeveral projects on the internet about motion detection with an ESP32 cam use an external PIR sensor to trigger the video recording.\nWhat's the problem with that approach? \n1. External hardware\nFirst of all, you need external hardware. If you're using a breadboard, no problem, you just need a couple more wires and you're good to go. But I have a nice M5stick camera (no affiliate link), that's already well packaged, so it won't be that easy to add a PIR sensor.\n2. Field of View\nPIR sensors have a limited FOV (field of view), so you will need more than one to cover the whole range of the camera. \nMy camera, for example, has fish-eye lens which give me 160° of view. Most cheap PIR sensors have a 120° field of view, so one will not suffice. This adds even more space to my project.\n3.
