Sadly, computing the transform over the whole spectrum of the signal still requires O(NlogN) with the best implementation (FFT - Fast Fourier Transform); we would like to achieve faster computation on our microcontrollers.\nIn this post I propose a partial, naive linear-time implementation of the Fourier Transform you can use to extract features from your data for Machine Learning models.\n\n\nTable of contentsTraining-aware FFTAccuracy comparisonHow to use Principal FFT in PythonHow to use Principal FFT in CBenchmarking\nDISCLAIMER\nThe contents of this post represent my own knowledge and are not supported by any academic work (as far as I know). It may really be the case that the findings of my work don't apply to your own projects; yet, I think this idea can turn useful in solving certain kind of problems.\nTraining-aware FFT\nFourier transform is used to describe a signal over its entire frequency range. This is useful in a number of applications, but here we're focused on the FT for the sole purpose of extracting features to be used with Machine learning models.\nFor this reason, we don't actually need a full description of the input signal: we're only interested in extracting some kind of signature that a ML model can use to distinguish among the different classes. Noticing that in a signal spectrum most frequencies have a low magnitude (as you can see in the picture above), the idea to only keep the most important frequencies came to my mind as a mean to speed up the computation on resource constrained microcontrollers.\nI was thinking to a kind of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), but using FFT spectrum as features.\nSince we will have a training set with the raw signals, we would like to select the most prominent frequencies among all the samples and apply the computation only on t","tags":"microml Arduino Machine learning"},"http://eloquent.blog/2020/08/better-word-classification-with-arduino-33-ble-sense-and-machine-learning/":{"url":"http://eloquent.blog/2020/08/better-word-classification-with-arduino-33-ble-sense-and-machine-learning/","title":"Better word classification with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Machine Learning","summary":"Let's revamp the post I wrote about word classification using Machine Learning on Arduino, this time using a proper microphone (the MP34DT05 mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense) instead of a chinese, analog one: will the results improve?\nfrom https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-audio-processing-complete-engineers-course/\n\nTable of contentsPulse-density modulation (a.k.a.

Even though this assumption doesn't hold true in the vast majority of the cases, they often perform very good at many classification tasks, so they're quite popular.\nGaussian Naive Bayes stack another (mostly wrong) assumption: that the variables exhibit a Gaussian probability distribution.\nI (and many others like me) will never understand how it is possible that so many wrong assumptions lead to such good performances!\nNevertheless, what is important to us is that sklearn implements GaussianNB, so we easily train such a classifier.\nThe most interesting part is that GaussianNB can be tuned with just a single parameter: var_smoothing.\nDon't ask me what it does in theory: in practice you change it and your accuracy can boost.

PCA) will help you shrink your models and even achieve higher prediction accuracy.\n\n\nWhy dimensionality reduction on Arduino microcontrollers?\nDimensionality reduction is a tecnique you see often in Machine Learning projects. By stripping away &quot;unimportant&quot; or redundant information, it generally helps speeding up the training process and achieving higher classification performances.\nSince we now know we can run Machine Learning on Arduino boards and embedded microcontrollers, it can become a key tool at our disposal to squeeze out the most out of our boards.\nIn the specific case of resource-constrained devices as old Arduino boards (the UNO for example, with only 2 kb of RAM), it can become a decisive turn in unlocking even more application scenarios where the high dimensionality of the input features would not allow any model to fit.\nLet's take the Gesture classification project as an example: among the different classifiers we trained, only one fitted on the Arduino UNO, since most of them required too much flash memory due to the high dimension of features (90) and support vectors (25 to 61).\nIn this post I will resume that example and see if dimensionality reduction can help reduce this gap.\nIf you are working on a project with many features, let me know in the comments so I can create a detailed list of real world examples.\nHow to export PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to plain C\nAmong the many algorithms available for dimensionality reduction, I decided to start with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) because it's one of the most widespread.

Thanks to the micromlgen package, you can run One Class SVM on your Arduino microcontorller.\n\n\nWhat is anomaly / novelty detection useful for?\nDetect noise or anomalies\nAs the name implies, anomaly detection can be used to monitor a stream of data and alert you when something unexpected happens.\nThink of an Industrial IoT setup where you have a bunch of sensors monitoring the working state of a production plant: you want to know as soon as possible if something bad is gonna happen.\nIn this case, anomaly detection tells you if your machinery is acting in a different way from the normal state so you can take action.\nIgnore irrelevant data\n(This application was suggested from two of my readers)\nSay you're developing a super simple word classification project: you want to distinguish door bell from fire alarm (as per one of the two readers).\nSo you train your SVM classifier and use micromlgen to run it on your Arduino microcontroller.\nIt works well, but we have a problem: you live in a noisy environment with many sounds, so not all of them will either be door bells or fire alarms. Since your classifier is binary, it has to classify all of the sounds as either A or B.\nThe solution will be novelty detection: before running the binary SVM, you run the OneClassSVM to filter known sounds (bell and alarm) from unknown ones (eg. dog barking).\nIf OneClassSVM predicts the sound as a novelty, you discard it since it's of no interest for you.

Many of real-world problems, however, are multiclass: you have 3 or more possible outcomes to distinguish from.\nThere are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n\nOne vs All: if your classifier is able to output a confidence score of its prediction, for N classes you train N classifiers, each able to recognize a single class. During inference, you pick the &quot;most confident&quot; one.\nOne vs One: for N classes, you train N * (N-1) / 2 classifiers, one for each couple of classes. During inference, each classifier makes a prediction and you pick the class with the highest number of votes.\n\nSince SGD and Passive-Aggressive don't output a confidence score, I implemented the One vs One algorithm to tackle the multiclass classification problem on microcontrollers.\nActually, One vs One is not a new type of classifier: it is really a &quot;coordinator&quot; class that sorts which samples go to which classifier.
