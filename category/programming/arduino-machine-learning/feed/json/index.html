Since I like SVM, I ported the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm to plain C, ready to be deployed to embedded devices.\nNow, that kind of algorithm works in the so-called &quot;batch-mode&quot;: it needs all the training data to be available in memory to learn.\nThis may be a limiting factor on resource-constrained devices, since it poses an upper bound to the number of samples you can train on. And when working with high-dimensional datasets, the number of samples could be not enough to achieve good accuracy.\nEnter incremental learning\nTo solve this limitation, you need a totally different kind of learning algorithms: you need incremental (a.k.a online a.k.a out of core) learning.\nIncremental learning works by inspecting one training sample at a time, instead of all at once.\nThe clear advantage is that you have a tiny memory footprint. And this is a huge advantage.\nThe clear disadvantage is that you don't have the &quot;big picture&quot; of your data, so:\n\nthe end result will probably be affected by the order of presentation of the samples\nyou may not be able to achieve top accuracy\n\nPassive-aggressive classifier\nPassive-aggressive classification is one of the available incremental learning algorithms and it is very simple to implement, since it has a closed-form update rule.\nPlease refer to this short explanation on Passive-aggressive classifiers for a nice description with images.\nThe core concept is that the classifier adjusts it weight vector for each mis-classified training sample it receives, trying to get it correct.\n\nBenchmarks\nI run a couple benchmark on my Esp32 to assess both accuracy and training time.\nFirst of all: it is fast!. When I say it is fast I mean it takes ~1ms to train on 400 samples x 30 features each.\nTalking about accuracy instead... Uhm...\nAccuracy vary. Greatly. \nYou can achieve 100% on some datasets. \nAnd 40% on others. But on those same datasets you can achieve &gt;85% if training on a different number of samples. Or in a different order.\nI guess this is the tradeoff for such a simple and space-efficient algorithm.\nI report my results in the following table. It is not meant to be an exhaustive benchmark of the classifier, since those number will vary based on the order of presentation, but still you can get an idea of what it is able to achieve.\n\n\n\nDataset size\nTrain samples\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nBREAST CANCER\n\n\n\n\n567 samples\n20\n62\n\n\n30 features\n40\n37\n\n\n\n60\n63\n\n\n\n100\n39\n\n\n\n150\n38\n\n\n\n200\n64\n\n\n\n250\n61\n\n\n\n300\n69\n\n\n\n350\n73\n\n\n\n400\n85\n\n\nIRIS\n\n\n\n\n100 samples\n10\n50\n\n\n4 features\n20\n51\n\n\n\n40\n100\n\n\n\n60\n100\n\n\n\n80\n100\n\n\nDIGITS\n\n\n\n\n358 samples\n20\n98\n\n\n64 features\n40\n98\n\n\n\n60\n99\n\n\n\n100\n100\n\n\n\n150\n100\n\n\n\n200\n99\n\n\n\n250\n98\n\n\n\n300\n95\n\n\nCLEVELAND HEART DISEASE\n\n\n\n\n212 samples\n20\n76\n\n\n13 features\n40\n24\n\n\n\n60\n77\n\n\n\n100\n19\n\n\n\n120\n82\n\n\n\n140\n78\n\n\n\n180\n88\n\n\n\nTime to code\nHere I'll report an extract of the example code you can find on Github for this classifier.\n#include &quot;EloquentPassiveAggressiveClassifier.h&quot;\n#include &quot;EloquentAccuracyScorer.h&quot;\n#include &quot;iris.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    int trainSamples;\n    PassiveAggressiveClassifier&lt;FEATURES_DIM&gt; clf;\n    AccuracyScorer scorer;\n\n    trainSamples = readSerialNumber(&quot;How many samples will you use as training?&quot;, DATASET_SIZE - 2);\n\n    if (trainSamples == 0)\n        return;\n\n    clf.setC(1);\n\n    // train\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; trainSamples; i++)\n        clf.fitOne(X[i], y[i]);\n\n    // predict\n    for (uint16_t i = trainSamples; i &lt; DATASET_SIZE; i++) {\n        int predicted = clf.predict(X[i]);\n        int actual = y[i] &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1;\n\n        scorer.scoreOne(actual, predicted);\n    }\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Accuracy: &quot;);\n    Serial.print(round(100 * scorer.accuracy()));\n    Serial.print(&quot;% out of &quot;);\n    Serial.print(scorer.support());\n    Serial.println(&quot; predictions&quot;);\n}\n\nOn the project page you will find the code to reproduce these numbers.\n\nL'articolo Passive-aggressive classifier for embedded devices proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

For an SVM to be valid, all values must be greater than or equal to 0, and at least one value on each side needs to be &quot;equal&quot; to 0, which will be your support vectors. Since it is highly unlikely that you will actually get values equal perfectly to 0, you set tolerance to allow a bit of wiggle room.&quot; (quoted from pythonprogramming)\nmaxIter: set an upper bound to the number of iterations the algorithm can take to converge\npasses: max # of times to iterate over \u03b1\u2019s without changing\nalphaTol: alfpha coefficients determine which samples from the training set are to be considered support vectors and so be included during the inference procedure. This value discards support vectors with an alpha too small to be noticeable.\n\nFit\nelse if (command == &quot;fit&quot;) {\n        Serial.print(&quot;How many samples will you record? &quot;);\n        numSamples = readSerialNumber();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numSamples; i++) {\n            Serial.print(i + 1);\n            Serial.print(&quot;/&quot;);\n            Serial.print(numSamples);\n            Serial.println(&quot; Which class does the sample belongs to, 1 or -1?&quot;);\n            y_train[i] = readSerialNumber() &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1;\n            getFeatures(X_train[i]);\n        }\n\n        Serial.print(&quot;Start training... &quot;);\n        classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, numSamples);\n        Serial.println(&quot;Done&quot;);\n    }\nThis is the core of the project. Here we are loading the samples to train our classifier &quot;live&quot; on the board.\nSince this is an interactive demo, the program prompts us to define how many samples we'll load and, one by one, which class they belong to.\nNow there are a few important things to keep in mind:\n\nnumSamples: sadly, C has no easy way to know the size of an array, so we have to be explicit about it. To train the classifier, it is mandatory that you do know I many samples you're passing to it\ngetFeatures() is the function that reads the training sample. It is actually a &quot;proxy&quot; to your own custom logic: in this example it reads the TCS3200, in your project it could read an accelerometer or the like.\nfit(): this is where the magic happens. With this single line of code you're training the SVM on the training data; when the functions ends, the classifier will have updated its internal state with the coefficients it needs to classify new samples\n\nPredict\nColorClassificationTrainingExample.ino\nelse if (command == &quot;predict&quot;) {\n        int label;\n        float x[FEATURES_DIM];\n\n        getFeatures(x);\n        Serial.print(&quot;Predicted label is &quot;);\n        Serial.println(classifier.predict(X_train, x));\n    }\nNow that our classifier has been trained, we can finally make use of it to classify new samples.\nAs easy as it can be, you just call its predict method.\nAs you can see, the predict method requires the X_train matrix other than the new sample vector\nAnd that's it: you can now complete your Machine learning task on your microcontroller from start to end, without the need of a PC.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCheck the full project code on Github\n\nFull example\nColorClassificationTrainingExample.ino\n#include &lt;EloquentSVMSMO.h&gt;\n#include &quot;RGB.h&quot;\n\n#define MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES 20\n#define FEATURES_DIM 3\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nint numSamples;\nRGB rgb(2, 3, 4);\nfloat X_train[MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES][FEATURES_DIM];\nint y_train[MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES];\nSVMSMO&lt;FEATURES_DIM&gt; classifier(linearKernel);\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    rgb.begin();\n\n    classifier.setC(5);\n    classifier.setTol(1e-5);\n    classifier.setMaxIter(10000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!Serial.available()) {\n        delay(100);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    String command = Serial.readStringUntil(&#039;\\n&#039;);\n\n    if (command == &quot;help&quot;) {\n        Serial.println(&quot;Available commands:&quot;);\n        Serial.println(&quot;\\tfit: train the classifier on a new set of samples&quot;);\n        Serial.println(&quot;\\tpredict: classify a new sample&quot;);\n        Serial.println(&quot;\\tinspect: print X_train and y_train&quot;);\n    }\n    else if (command == &quot;fit&quot;) {\n        Serial.print(&quot;How many samples will you record?
