This seems to be an alien topic in the Arduino world and I can't really explain why.\n99% of the libraries out there deal with this problem in one of two modes:\n\nignoring it altogether, so you have an MPU6050.h library, which elects itself as the only one implementation possible to access the MPU6050 accelerometer in the world\nprefixing each library file, so you get the Adafruit_Si7021 class\n\nThe case for Adafruit_Si7021 should not exist in my opinion: use the damn namespaces!Click To Tweet\nWith namespaces, it would become:\nusing namespace Adafruit;\n\nSi7021 si;\nHow to use\nFirst of all, all the 4 implementations accept a single constructor argument: the pin number.\n DigitalOut led(BUILTIN_LED);\n DigitalIn pushButton(10);\n AnalogIn potentiometer(A0);\n AnalogOut pwmLed(8);\nThen it is good practice to init your pins in the setup.\n void setup() {\n    led.begin();\n    pushButton.begin();\n    potentiometer.begin();\n    pwmLed.begin();\n }\nAll the 4 classes let you ask for the pin current value via the value() method:\n void test() {\n    // DigitalIn returns the last read value, as 0/1\n    digitalIn.value();\n\n    // AnalogIn returns the last read value, in the range [0, 1024]\n    analogIn.value();\n\n    // DigitalOut returns the last written value, as 0/1\n    digitalOut.value();\n\n    // AnaloglOut returns the last written value, in the range [0, 255]\n    analogOut.value();\n }\nAt this point each class will provide its specialized methods.\nDigitalIn\nvoid test() {\n    // configure pin as INPUT_PULLUP\n    pin.pullup();\n\n    // configure pin as Active Low \n    // that is, pin is ON when digitalRead() is LOW\n    pin.activeLow();\n\n    // read and update pin value\n    pin.read();\n\n    // test if pin is on (doesn&#039;t read the pin)\n    pin.isOn();\n\n    // test if pin is off (doesn&#039;t read the pin)\n    pin.isOff();\n\n    // test if pin value changed from last reading\n    pin.changed();\n}\nDigitalOut\nvoid test() {\n    // set pin as Active Low\n    // that is, turnOn writes LOW\n    pin.activeLow();\n\n    // turn pin on\n    pin.turnOn();\n\n    // turn pin off\n    pin.turnOff();\n\n    // toggle\n    pin.toggle();\n\n    // blink N times at intervals of X milliseconds\n    pin.blink(N, X);\n}\nAnalogIn\nvoid test() {\n    // read current pin value\n    pin.read();\n\n    // get pin previous value\n    pin.prev();\n\n    // get difference between current value and previous\n    pin.delta();\n\n    // get absolute value of delta()\n    pin.absDelta();\n}\nAnalogOut\nvoid test() {\n    // write value X to pin\n    pin.write(X);\n}\n\nIf you don't believe a whole class is worthwhile to work with pins, I'll show a few use cases to illustrate my point.\nUse case #1: active low LED\nThe ESP8266 has a builtin LED you can control, but it is an active low one: it will turn on when you write LOW. In this case, digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, LOW) can be misleading regarding your actual intentions. \nIt doesn't look intuitive,  it doesn't look eloquent! builtinLed.turnOn() does, however. All you need to get it working correctly is calling builtinLed.activeLow() once in your setup.\n// BEFORE\nvoid loop() {\n    // to turn the builtin LED on\n    digitalWrite(led, LOW);\n}\n// AFTER\nDigitalOut buildtinLed;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    builtinLed.activeLow();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // to turn the builtin LED on\n    builtinLed.turnOn();\n}\nUse case #2: toggle\nIf you need to toggle the current state of a digital output, you need an helper variable to keep track of the state and remember to always update that variable when you write to the output.\nWith a class, the state is tightly bound to the instance, so you have a single source of truth: turnOn(), turnOff() and toggle() will take care of updating the inner state accordingly.\n// BEFORE\n#define LED 1\n\nbool ledState = true;\n\nloop() {\n    digitalWrite(LED, ledState);\n    ledState = !ledState\n}\n// AFTER\nDigitalOut led(1);\n\nvoid loop() {\n    led.toggle();\n}\nUse case #3: analog delta\nWhat if you have an analog input and want to know if its valued changed by at least X from your latest reading? You would need an helper variable again. \nNow imagine if you have 5 analog inputs you want to track: you'll end up with 10 variables and of course you have again to always keep both in sync.\nAnalogIn conveniently provides delta() and absDelta() methods that give you the change from the previous reading and will always be in sync. Awesome!\n// BEFORE\n#define INPUT1 A1\n#define INPUT2 A2\n\nuint16_t current1, prev1;\nuint16_t current2, prev2;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    prev1 = current1;\n    current1 = analogRead(INPUT1);\n    prev2 = current2;\n    current2 = analogRead(INPUT2);\n\n    if (abs(current1 - prev1) &gt; THRESHOLD)\n        ...\n// AFTER\nAnalogIn input1(A1), input2(A2);\n\nvoid loop() {\n    input1.read();\n    input2.read();\n\n    if (input1.absDelta() &gt; THRESHOLD)\n        ...\n}\nDid you find this tutorial useful?
