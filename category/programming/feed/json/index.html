Now it is time to upgrade your toolbelt with a new item: One-vs-One multiclass classifier.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1079\"></span></p>\n<h2>One vs One</h2>\n<p>Many classifiers are, by nature, binary: they can only distinguish the positive class from the negative one. Many of real-world problems, however, are multiclass: you have 3 or more possible outcomes to distinguish from.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways to achieve this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>One vs All</strong>: if your classifier is able to output a confidence score of its prediction, for N classes you train N classifiers, each able to recognize a single class.

Now it is time to upgrade your toolbelt with a new item: One-vs-One multiclass classifier.\n\nOne vs One\nMany classifiers are, by nature, binary: they can only distinguish the positive class from the negative one. Many of real-world problems, however, are multiclass: you have 3 or more possible outcomes to distinguish from.\nThere are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n\nOne vs All: if your classifier is able to output a confidence score of its prediction, for N classes you train N classifiers, each able to recognize a single class. During inference, you pick the &quot;most confident&quot; one.\nOne vs One: for N classes, you train N * (N-1) / 2 classifiers, one for each couple of classes. During inference, each classifier makes a prediction and you pick the class with the highest number of votes.\n\nSince SGD and Passive-Aggressive don't output a confidence score, I implemented the One vs One algorithm to tackle the multiclass classification problem on microcontrollers.\nActually, One vs One is not a new type of classifier: it is really a &quot;coordinator&quot; class that sorts which samples go to which classifier.

Now you can use it on your microcontroller with ease.\n\nA brief recap on Stochastic Gradient Descent\nIf you ever worked with Machine learning, you surely know about Gradient descent: it is an iterative algorithm to optimize a loss function. \nIt is much general-purpose, in the sense that it is not bound to a particular application, but it has been heavily used in Neural networks in the recent years.\nYet, it can be used as a classifier on its own if you set its loss function as the classification error.\n\nThis is the core update rule of Gradient descent: quite simple.\nAs you see, there's a summation in the formula: this means we need to cycle through the entire training set to compute the update to the weights.\nIn case of large datasets, this can be slow or not possible at all.\nAnd requires a lot of memory.\nAnd we don't have memory on microcontrollers.\nSo we need Stochastic gradient descent.\nStochastic gradient descent has the same exact update rule, but it is applied on the single training sample.\nImagine the summation goes from 1 to 1, instead of m.\nThat's it.\n\nHow to use\nThe pattern of use is similar to that of the Passive Aggressive classifier: you have the fitOne and predict methods.\nFirst of all, download the library from Github.\n#include &lt;EloquentSGD.h&gt;\n#include &lt;EloquentAccuracyScorer.h&gt;\n#include &quot;iris.h&quot;\n\n#define VERBOSE\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    int trainSamples;\n    int retrainingCycles;\n    SGD&lt;FEATURES_DIM&gt; clf;\n    AccuracyScorer scorer;\n\n    // ....\n\n    // train\n    for (uint16_t cycle = 0; cycle &lt; retrainingCycles; cycle++)\n        for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; trainSamples; i++)\n            clf.fitOne(X[i], y[i]);\n\n    // predict\n    for (uint16_t i = trainSamples; i &lt; DATASET_SIZE; i++) {\n        int predicted = clf.predict(X[i]);\n        int actual = y[i];\n\n        scorer.scoreOne(actual, predicted);\n    }\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Accuracy: &quot;);\n    Serial.print(round(100 * scorer.accuracy()));\n    Serial.print(&quot;% out of &quot;);\n    Serial.print(scorer.support());\n    Serial.println(&quot; predictions&quot;);\n}\nIn this case we're working with known datasets, so we cycle through them for the training, but if you're learning &quot;on-line&quot;, from samples generated over time, it will work exactly the same.\nA bit of momentum\nStochastic gradient descent works quite well out of the box in most cases.\nSometimes, however, its updates can start &quot;oscillating&quot;.\n\nTo solve this problem, it has been proposed the momentum technique, which can both speed up learning and increase the accuracy.\nIn my personal tests, I was able to achieve up to +5% in accuracy on the majority of datasets.\nTo use it, you only need to set a decay factor between 0 and 1.\nSGD clf;\n\nclf.momentum(0.5);\nRun on your own\nOn Github you can find the full example with some benchmark datasets to try on your own.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe example is interactive an will ask you how many samples to use for the training and how many times to cycle through them.\nThis is something you should consider: if you have a training set and can store it somehow (in memory or on Flash for example), re-presenting the same samples to the SGD classifier could (and probably will) increase its performance if done correctly.\nThis happens because the algorithm needs some time to converge and if it doesn't receive enough samples it won't learn properly.\nOf course, if you re-use the same samples over and over again, you're likely to overfit.\nL'articolo Stochastic Gradient Descent on your microcontroller proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

You will need to keep this data always with you, since it's required also during the inference</li>\n<li><code>y_train</code>: this array contains, for each training sample, the class it belongs to: 1 or -1</li>\n<li><code>linearKernel</code>: this is the kernel function for the SVM classifier (you can read more <a href=\"#\">here</a>). You can pass your own kernel other than linear (for example <code>poly</code> or <code>rbf</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this specific example, we're using the <code>RGB</code> class to handle the TCS3200 sensor reading, but this will change based on the dataset you want to train on.

For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points&quot; (quoted from <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/31066/what-is-the-influence-of-c-in-svms-with-linear-kernel\">stackexchange</a>)</li>\n<li><code>tol</code>: &quot;The tol parameter is a setting for the SVM's tolerance in optimization.

            "content_text": "In the previous post we learnt it is possible to train a Machine learning classifier directly on a microcontroller. In this post we'll look into how to do it to classify colors.\n\nThis will be an hands-on guide, so let's walk throughout each step you need to complete to run the example. \nI setup this very example as a basis for your future projects, so you can easily swap the color classification task for any other one you could think of.\nDefinitions\n#ifdef ESP32\n#define min(a, b) (a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b)\n#define max(a, b) (a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b)\n#define abs(x) ((x) &gt; 0 ? (x) : -(x))\n#endif\n\n#include &lt;EloquentSVMSMO.h&gt;\n#include &quot;RGB.h&quot;\n\n#define MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES 20\n#define FEATURES_DIM 3\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ML;\n\nint numSamples;\nRGB rgb(2, 3, 4);\nfloat X_train[MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES][FEATURES_DIM];\nint y_train[MAX_TRAINING_SAMPLES];\nSVMSMO&lt;FEATURES_DIM&gt; classifier(linearKernel);\nWhen training a classifier on your microcontroller there are some things that are mandatory:\n\n#include &lt;EloquentSVMSMO.h&gt;: this is the library that implements the SVM learning algorithm\nX_train: this is a matrix where each row represents a training sample. You will need to keep this data always with you, since it's required also during the inference\ny_train: this array contains, for each training sample, the class it belongs to: 1 or -1\nlinearKernel: this is the kernel function for the SVM classifier (you can read more here). You can pass your own kernel other than linear (for example poly or rbf)\n\nIn this specific example, we're using the RGB class to handle the TCS3200 sensor reading, but this will change based on the dataset you want to train on. Also, since our features are going to be the R, G and B components of a color, FEATURES_DIM is set to 3.\nSetup\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    rgb.begin();\n\n    classifier.setC(5);\n    classifier.setTol(1e-5);\n    classifier.setMaxIter(10000);\n}\nThe setup does not contain any logic really. You can use this part to configure the parameters of the classifier:\n\nC: &quot;The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points&quot; (quoted from stackexchange)\ntol: &quot;The tol parameter is a setting for the SVM's tolerance in optimization. Recall that yi(xi.w+b)-1 &gt;= 0. For an SVM to be valid, all values must be greater than or equal to 0, and at least one value on each side needs to be &quot;equal&quot; to 0, which will be your support vectors. Since it is highly unlikely that you will actually get values equal perfectly to 0, you set tolerance to allow a bit of wiggle room.&quot; (quoted from pythonprogramming)\nmaxIter: set an upper bound to the number of iterations the algorithm can take to converge\npasses: max # of times to iterate over \u03b1\u2019s without changing\nalphaTol: alfpha coefficients determine which samples from the training set are to be considered support vectors and so be included during the inference procedure. This value discards support vectors with an alpha too small to be noticeable.\n\nFit\nelse if (command == &quot;fit&quot;) {\n        Serial.print(&quot;How many samples will you record? &quot;);\n        numSamples = readSerialNumber();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numSamples; i++) {\n            Serial.print(i + 1);\n            Serial.print(&quot;/&quot;);\n            Serial.print(numSamples);\n            Serial.println(&quot; Which class does the sample belongs to, 1 or -1?&quot;);\n            y_train[i] = readSerialNumber() &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1;\n            getFeatures(X_train[i]);\n        }\n\n        Serial.print(&quot;Start training... &quot;);\n        classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, numSamples);\n        Serial.println(&quot;Done&quot;);\n    }\nThis is the core of the project. Here we are loading the samples to train our classifier &quot;live&quot; on the board.\nSince this is an interactive demo, the program prompts us to define how many samples we'll load and, one by one, which class they belong to.\nNow there are a few important things to keep in mind:\n\nnumSamples: sadly, C has no easy way to know the size of an array, so we have to be explicit about it.

What if you could <strong>train</strong> a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Onboard-IRIS-dataset-training-time.png\" alt=\"Onboard IRIS dataset training time\" /></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-982\"></span></p>\n<p>When I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.</p>\n<p>As simple as this.</p>\n<p>Training is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.</p>\n<p>And this yield true until now.</p>\n<p>Until my reader <a href=\"https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen\">Joao Carvalho</a>, in the comments on the post about <a href=\"/2020/02/even-smaller-machine-learning-models-for-your-mcu/\">an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models</a> that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. </p>\n<p>In the past I replied <em>&quot;No way&quot;</em> to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/svmjs/blob/master/lib/svm.js\">Javascript implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/svmjs/blob/master/test/smo.pdf\">simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm</a>.</p>\n<p>At a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.</p>\n<p>And in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.</p>\n<p>Then I deployed it to my ESP32 and... <strong>it worked</strong>!</p>\n<p>My first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.</p>\n<p>But I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.</p>\n<p>Execution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.<br />\nThe results are summarized in the following table and

            "content_text": "As of now, we know it is possible to run Machine learning inference on tiny microcontrollers thanks to Tensorflow for Micro and my very own library MicroML. What if you could train a classifier directly on the microcontroller, too?\n\n\nWhen I first started this journey in the world of Machine learning on microcontrollers, one fact was set in stone for me: you train your classifier once and for all on a PC, then deploy it to your microcontroller.\nAs simple as this.\nTraining is a heavy process, requires lots of computations and memory. You just want a machine as powerful as possible to carry out this task as fast as possible.\nMoreover, it is a one-time task: once your classifier has been trained, it needs not to be updated anymore.\nAnd this yield true until now.\nUntil my reader Joao Carvalho, in the comments on the post about an alternative to SVM which produces much smaller models that I strongly invite you to read, challenged me with this idea of running the SVM training directly on the microcontroller. \nIn the past I replied &quot;No way&quot; to people asking about this topic on forums, but Joao was so kind to link me a Javascript implementation of the simplified SVM SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm.\nAt a first glance it looked quite easy to port from Javascript to C, so I gave it a try.\nAnd in fact it only took me 30 minutes to get it working on my PC.\nThen I deployed it to my ESP32 and... it worked!\nMy first try was with 10 samples from the the IRIS dataset: it only took almost no time to train.\nBut I know SVM training and inferencing time grows rapidly with the number of training samples.\nExecution time will be the most limiting factor for this kind of task, so I created a benchmarking setup to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on different dataset sizes and features dimensions.\nThe results are summarized in the following table and plots.\n\n\n\nFeatures size\nTraining size\nTraining time (ms)\nUnit inference time (ms)\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n4\n10\n0\n0,011\n80\n\n\n4\n20\n4\n0,013\n85\n\n\n4\n30\n11\n0,014\n90\n\n\n4\n40\n38\n0,017\n91\n\n\n4\n50\n47\n0,020\n86\n\n\n4\n60\n80\n0,025\n87\n\n\n30\n10\n22\n0,014\n71\n\n\n30\n20\n1000\n0,017\n61\n\n\n30\n30\n3500\n0,020\n66\n\n\n30\n40\n20000\n0,025\n85\n\n\n30\n50\n32800\n0,033\n83\n\n\n30\n60\n71400\n0,050\n80\n\n\n\n* all benchmark are obtained on an ESP32 board\n** the inference took actually sometimes less than 1ms to run for all the test samples, so it was rounded to 1ms and divided by the number of samples\n\n\nWe can see from the table that for the Iris dataset, which has 4-dimensional features, the training process is quite fast: 80ms to train on 60 samples.\nThings become much different when training on the Breast cancer dataset, with its 30 features per sample.

Let's see the easiest possible way to view your thermal camera streaming without an LCD display!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/thermal-image-rgb-vs-ascii.jpg\" alt=\"Arduino thermal image rgb vs ascii\" /></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-956\"></span></p>\n<h2>MLX90640 thermal camera</h2>\n<p>For Arduino there are essentially two thermal camera available: the AMG8833 and the MLX90640.</p>\n<p>The AMG8833 is 8x8 and the MLX90640 is 32x24.</p>\n<p>They're not cheap, it is true.</p>\n<p>But if you have to spend money, I strongly advise you to buy the MLX90640: I have one and it's not that accurate. I can't imagine how low definition would be the AMG8833.</p>\n<p>If you want to actually get something meaningful from the camera, the AMG8833 won't give you any good results.</p>\n<p>Sure, you can do interpolation: interpolation would give you <em>the impression</em> you have a better definition, but you're just &quot;inventing&quot; values you don't actually have.</p>\n<p>For demo projects it could be enough. But for any serious application, spend 20$ more and buy an MLX90640.</p>\n<h2>MLX90640 eloquent library</h2>\n<p>As you may know if you read <a href=\"/2019/11/how-to-write-clean-arduino-code/\">my previous posts</a>, I strongly believe in &quot;eloquent&quot; code, that is code that's as easy as possible to read.</p>\n<p>How many lines do you think you need to read a MLX90640 camera? Well, not that much in fact.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &quot;EloquentMLX90640.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Sensors;\n\nfloat buffer[768];\nMLX90640 camera;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  if (!camera.begin()) {\n    Serial.println(&quot;Init error&quot;);\n    delay(50000);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  camera.read(buffer);\n  delay(3000);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If you skip the declaration lines, you only need a <code>begin()</code> and <code>read()</code> call.</p>\n<p>That's it.</p>\n<p>What <code>begin()</code> does is to run all of the boilerplate code I mentioned earlier (checking the connection and initializing the parameters).</p>\n<p><code>read()</code> populates the buffer you pass as argument with the temperature readings.</p>\n<p>From now on, you're free to handle that array as you may like: this is the most flexible way for the library to handle any use-case. It simply does not pose any restriction.</p>\n<p>You can find the camera code <a href=\"#anchor-camera-code\">at the end of the page</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentArduino/blob/master/examples/ThermalCameraToAsciiArtExample/EloquentMLX90640.h\">on Github</a>.</p>\n<h2>Printing as ASCII Art</h2>\n<p>Now that you have this data, you may want to actually &quot;view&quot; it. Well, that's not an easy task as one may hope.</p>\n<p>You will need an LCD if you want to create a standalone product. If you have one, it'll be the best, it's a really cute project to build.</p>\n<p>Here's a video from Adafruit that showcases even a 3D-printed case.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZjQEykbvb5w\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>If you don't have an LCD, though, it is less practical to access your image.</p>\n<p>I did this in the past, and it meant creating a Python script reading the serial port every second and updating a plot.<br />\nIt works, sure, but it's not the most convenient way to handle it.</p>\n<p>This is the reason I thought about ASCII art: it is used to draw images in plain text, so you can view them directly in the serial monitor.</p>\n<p>Of course they will not be as accurate or representative as RGB images, but can give you an idea of what you're framing in realtime.</p>\n<p>I wrote a class to do this. Once imported in your sketch, it is super easy to get it working.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &quot;EloquentAsciiArt.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ImageProcessing;\n\nfloat buffer[768];\nuint8_t bufferBytes[768];\nMLX90640 camera;\n// we need to specify width and height of the image\nAsciiArt&lt;32, 24&gt; art(bufferBytes);\n\nvoid loop() {\n  camera.read(buffer);\n\n  // convert float image to uint8\n  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 768; i++) {\n    // assumes readings are in the range 0-40 degrees\n    // change as per your need\n    bufferBytes[i] = map(buffer[i], 0, 40, 0, 255);\n  }\n\n  // print to Serial with a border of 2 characters, to distinguish one image from the next\n  art.print(&amp;Serial, 2);\n  delay(2000);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, you need to create an <code>AsciiArt</code> object, map the image pixels in the range <code>0-255</code> and call the <code>print()</code> method: easy peasy!</p>\n<p>You can find the ASCII art generator code <a href=\"#anchor-ascii-art-code\">at the end of the page</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentArduino/blob/master/examples/ThermalCameraToAsciiArtExample/EloquentAsciiArt.h\">on Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the result of the sketch.

            "content_text": "Ever wanted to use your thermal camera with Arduino but found it difficult to go beyond the tutorials code? Let's see the easiest possible way to view your thermal camera streaming without an LCD display!\n\n\nMLX90640 thermal camera\nFor Arduino there are essentially two thermal camera available: the AMG8833 and the MLX90640.\nThe AMG8833 is 8x8 and the MLX90640 is 32x24.\nThey're not cheap, it is true.\nBut if you have to spend money, I strongly advise you to buy the MLX90640: I have one and it's not that accurate. I can't imagine how low definition would be the AMG8833.\nIf you want to actually get something meaningful from the camera, the AMG8833 won't give you any good results.\nSure, you can do interpolation: interpolation would give you the impression you have a better definition, but you're just &quot;inventing&quot; values you don't actually have.\nFor demo projects it could be enough. But for any serious application, spend 20$ more and buy an MLX90640.\nMLX90640 eloquent library\nAs you may know if you read my previous posts, I strongly believe in &quot;eloquent&quot; code, that is code that's as easy as possible to read.\nHow many lines do you think you need to read a MLX90640 camera? Well, not that much in fact.\n#include &quot;EloquentMLX90640.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Sensors;\n\nfloat buffer[768];\nMLX90640 camera;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  if (!camera.begin()) {\n    Serial.println(&quot;Init error&quot;);\n    delay(50000);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  camera.read(buffer);\n  delay(3000);\n}\nIf you skip the declaration lines, you only need a begin() and read() call.\nThat's it.\nWhat begin() does is to run all of the boilerplate code I mentioned earlier (checking the connection and initializing the parameters).\nread() populates the buffer you pass as argument with the temperature readings.\nFrom now on, you're free to handle that array as you may like: this is the most flexible way for the library to handle any use-case. It simply does not pose any restriction.\nYou can find the camera code at the end of the page or on Github.\nPrinting as ASCII Art\nNow that you have this data, you may want to actually &quot;view&quot; it. Well, that's not an easy task as one may hope.\nYou will need an LCD if you want to create a standalone product. If you have one, it'll be the best, it's a really cute project to build.\nHere's a video from Adafruit that showcases even a 3D-printed case.\n\nIf you don't have an LCD, though, it is less practical to access your image.\nI did this in the past, and it meant creating a Python script reading the serial port every second and updating a plot.\nIt works, sure, but it's not the most convenient way to handle it.\nThis is the reason I thought about ASCII art: it is used to draw images in plain text, so you can view them directly in the serial monitor.\nOf course they will not be as accurate or representative as RGB images, but can give you an idea of what you're framing in realtime.\nI wrote a class to do this. Once imported in your sketch, it is super easy to get it working.\n#include &quot;EloquentAsciiArt.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::ImageProcessing;\n\nfloat buffer[768];\nuint8_t bufferBytes[768];\nMLX90640 camera;\n// we need to specify width and height of the image\nAsciiArt&lt;32, 24&gt; art(bufferBytes);\n\nvoid loop() {\n  camera.read(buffer);\n\n  // convert float image to uint8\n  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 768; i++) {\n    // assumes readings are in the range 0-40 degrees\n    // change as per your need\n    bufferBytes[i] = map(buffer[i], 0, 40, 0, 255);\n  }\n\n  // print to Serial with a border of 2 characters, to distinguish one image from the next\n  art.print(&amp;Serial, 2);\n  delay(2000);\n}\nAs you can see, you need to create an AsciiArt object, map the image pixels in the range 0-255 and call the print() method: easy peasy!\nYou can find the ASCII art generator code at the end of the page or on Github.\nHere's the result of the sketch. It's a video of me putting my arms at the top of my head, once at a time, then standing up.\nResize the Serial Monitor as only a single frame at a time is visble to have a \"video streaming\" effect\n\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Thermal-ascii-speedup.mp4\nOf course the visual effect won't be as impressive as an RGB image, but you can clearly see my figure moving.\nThe real bad part is the &quot;glitch&quot; you see between each frame when the scrolling happens: this is something I don't know if it's possible to mitigate.\n\r\nCheck the full project code on Github\n\n\n#pragma once\n\n#include &quot;Wire.h&quot;\n#include &quot;MLX90640_API.h&quot;\n#include &quot;MLX90640_I2C_Driver.h&quot;\n\n#ifndef TA_SHIFT\n//Default shift for MLX90640 in open air\n#define TA_SHIFT 8\n#endif\n\nnamespace Eloquent {\n    namespace Sensors {\n\n        enum class MLX90640Status {\n            OK,\n            NOT_CONNECTED,\n            DUMP_ERROR,\n            PARAMETER_ERROR,\n            FRAME_ERROR\n        };\n\n        class MLX90640 {\n        public:\n            /**\n             *\n             * @param address\n             */\n            MLX90640(uint8_t address = 0x33) :\n                _address(address),\n                _status(MLX90640Status::OK) {\n\n            }\n\n            /**\n             *\n             * @return\n             */\n            bool begin() {\n                Wire.begin();\n                Wire.setClock(400000);\n\n                return isConnected() &amp;&amp;

SVM, on the other hand, computes 10 kernels and does 13 multiplications.\nThis is a recurring pattern, so RVM is much much faster in the inference process.\nDisclaimer\nmicromlgen and in particular port_rvm are work in progress: you may experience some glitches or it may not work in your specific case.
