            "content_html": "<p>You will be surprised by how much accuracy you can achieve in just a few kylobytes of resources: <strong>Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)</strong> are now available on your microcontrollers: highly RAM-optmized implementations for super-fast classification on embedded devices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DecisionTree.png\" alt=\"DecisionTree\" /></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1264\"></span></p>\n<h2>Decision Tree</h2>\n<p><strong>Decision Tree</strong> is without doubt one of the most well-known classification algorithms out there. It is so simple to understand that it was probably the first classifier you encountered in any Machine Learning course.</p>\n<p>I won't go into the details of how a Decision Tree classifier trains and selects the splits for the input features: here I will explain how a RAM-efficient porting of such a classifier is implemented.</p>\n<p>To an introduction visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning\">Wikipedia</a>; for a more in-depth guide visit <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/decision-tree-algorithm-explained.html\">KDNuggets</a>.</p>\n<p>Since we're willing to sacrifice program space (a.k.a flash) in favor of memory (a.k.a RAM), because RAM is the most scarce resource in the vast majority of microcontrollers, the smart way to port a Decision Tree classifier from Python to C is &quot;hard-coding&quot; the splits in code, without keeping any reference to them into variables.</p>\n<p>Here's what it looks like for a Decision tree that classifies the Iris dataset.</p>\n<p>As you can see, we're using <strong>0 bytes of RAM</strong> to get the classification result, since no variable is being allocated. On the other side, the program space will grow almost linearly with the number of splits.</p>\n<p>Since program space is often much greater than RAM on microcontrollers, this implementation exploits its abundance to be able to deploy larger models. How much large? It will depend on the flash size available: many new generations board (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, ST Nucleus...) have 1 Mb of flash, which will hold tens of thousands of splits. </p>\n<h2>Random Forest</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest\">Random Forest</a></strong> is just many Decision Trees joined together in a voting scheme. The core idea is that of <em>&quot;the wisdom of the corwd&quot;</em>, such that if many trees vote for a given class (having being trained on different subsets of the training set), that class is probably the true class.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2\">Towards Data Science</a> has a more detailed guide on Random Forest and how it balances the trees with the<em>bagging</em> tecnique.</p>\n<p>As easy as Decision Trees, Random Forest gets the exact same implementation with <strong>0 bytes of RAM</strong> required (it actually needs as many bytes as the number of classes to store the votes, but that's really negligible): it just hard-codes all its composing trees.</p>\n<h2>XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)</h2>\n<p>Extreme Gradient Boosting is <em>&quot;Gradient Boosting on steroids&quot;</em> and has gained much attention from the Machine learning community due to its top results in many data competitions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&quot;gradient boosting&quot; refers to the process of chaining a number of trees so that each tree tries to learn from the errors of the previous</li>\n<li>&quot;extreme&quot; refers to many software and hardware optimizations that greatly reduce the time it takes to train the model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can read <a href=\"https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0697-chenAemb.pdf\">the original paper about XGBoost here</a>.

            "content_text": "You will be surprised by how much accuracy you can achieve in just a few kylobytes of resources: Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) are now available on your microcontrollers: highly RAM-optmized implementations for super-fast classification on embedded devices.\n\n\nDecision Tree\nDecision Tree is without doubt one of the most well-known classification algorithms out there. It is so simple to understand that it was probably the first classifier you encountered in any Machine Learning course.\nI won't go into the details of how a Decision Tree classifier trains and selects the splits for the input features: here I will explain how a RAM-efficient porting of such a classifier is implemented.\nTo an introduction visit Wikipedia; for a more in-depth guide visit KDNuggets.\nSince we're willing to sacrifice program space (a.k.a flash) in favor of memory (a.k.a RAM), because RAM is the most scarce resource in the vast majority of microcontrollers, the smart way to port a Decision Tree classifier from Python to C is &quot;hard-coding&quot; the splits in code, without keeping any reference to them into variables.\nHere's what it looks like for a Decision tree that classifies the Iris dataset.\nAs you can see, we're using 0 bytes of RAM to get the classification result, since no variable is being allocated. On the other side, the program space will grow almost linearly with the number of splits.\nSince program space is often much greater than RAM on microcontrollers, this implementation exploits its abundance to be able to deploy larger models. How much large? It will depend on the flash size available: many new generations board (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, ST Nucleus...) have 1 Mb of flash, which will hold tens of thousands of splits. \nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest is just many Decision Trees joined together in a voting scheme. The core idea is that of &quot;the wisdom of the corwd&quot;, such that if many trees vote for a given class (having being trained on different subsets of the training set), that class is probably the true class.\nTowards Data Science has a more detailed guide on Random Forest and how it balances the trees with thebagging tecnique.\nAs easy as Decision Trees, Random Forest gets the exact same implementation with 0 bytes of RAM required (it actually needs as many bytes as the number of classes to store the votes, but that's really negligible): it just hard-codes all its composing trees.\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\nExtreme Gradient Boosting is &quot;Gradient Boosting on steroids&quot; and has gained much attention from the Machine learning community due to its top results in many data competitions.\n\n&quot;gradient boosting&quot; refers to the process of chaining a number of trees so that each tree tries to learn from the errors of the previous\n&quot;extreme&quot; refers to many software and hardware optimizations that greatly reduce the time it takes to train the model\n\nYou can read the original paper about XGBoost here. For a discursive description head to KDNuggets, if you want some more math refer to this blog post on Medium.\nPorting to plain C\nIf you followed my earlier posts on Gaussian Naive Bayes, SEFR, Relevant Vector Machine and Support Vector Machines, you already know how to port these new classifiers.\nIf you're new, you will need a couple things:\n\ninstall the micromlgen package with \n\npip install micromlgen\n\n(optionally, if you want to use Extreme Gradient Boosting) install the xgboost package with \n\npip install xgboost\n\nuse the micromlgen.port function to generate your plain C code\n\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nclf.fit(X, y)\nprint(port(clf))\nYou can then copy-past the C code and import it in your sketch.\nUsing in the Arduino sketch\nOnce you have the classifier code, create a new project named TreeClassifierExample and copy the classifier code into a file named DecisionTree.h (or RandomForest.h or XGBoost.h depending on the model you chose).\nThe copy the following to the main ino file.\n#include &quot;DecisionTree.h&quot;\n\nEloquent::ML::Port::DecisionTree clf;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    Serial.println(&quot;Begin&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float irisSample[4] = {6.2, 2.8, 4.8, 1.8};\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Predicted label (you should see &#039;2&#039;: &quot;);\n    Serial.println(clf.predict(irisSample));\n    delay(1000);\n}\nBechmarks\nHow do the 3 classifiers compare against each other?\nWe will evaluate a few keypoints:\n\ntraining time\naccuracy\nneeded RAM\nneeded Flash\n\nfor each classifier on a variety of datasets.

            "content_text": "Fourier Transform is probably the most well known algorithm for feature extraction from time-dependent data (in particular speech data), where frequency holds a great deal of information. Sadly, computing the transform over the whole spectrum of the signal still requires O(NlogN) with the best implementation (FFT - Fast Fourier Transform); we would like to achieve faster computation on our microcontrollers.\nIn this post I propose a partial, naive linear-time implementation of the Fourier Transform you can use to extract features from your data for Machine Learning models.\n\n\nTable of contentsTraining-aware FFTAccuracy comparisonHow to use Principal FFT in PythonHow to use Principal FFT in CBenchmarking\nDISCLAIMER\nThe contents of this post represent my own knowledge and are not supported by any academic work (as far as I know). It may really be the case that the findings of my work don't apply to your own projects; yet, I think this idea can turn useful in solving certain kind of problems.\nTraining-aware FFT\nFourier transform is used to describe a signal over its entire frequency range. This is useful in a number of applications, but here we're focused on the FT for the sole purpose of extracting features to be used with Machine learning models.\nFor this reason, we don't actually need a full description of the input signal: we're only interested in extracting some kind of signature that a ML model can use to distinguish among the different classes. Noticing that in a signal spectrum most frequencies have a low magnitude (as you can see in the picture above), the idea to only keep the most important frequencies came to my mind as a mean to speed up the computation on resource constrained microcontrollers.\nI was thinking to a kind of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), but using FFT spectrum as features.\nSince we will have a training set with the raw signals, we would like to select the most prominent frequencies among all the samples and apply the computation only on those: even using the naive implementation of FFT, this will yield a linear-time implementation.\nAccuracy comparison\nHow does this Principal FFT compare to, let's say, PCA as a dimensionality reduction algorithm w.r.t model accuracy? Let's see the numbers!\n\nDownload the Principal FFT benchmark spreadsheet\nI couldn't find many examples of the kind of datasets I wished to test, but in the image you can see different types of data:\n\nhuman activity classification from smartphone data\ngesture classification by IMU data\nMNIST handwritten digits image data\nfree speech audio data\n\nWe can note a couple findings:\n\nPrincipal FFT is almost on par with PCA after a certain number of components\nPrincipalFFT definitely leaves PCA behind on audio data\n\nFrom even this simple analysis you should be convinced that Principal FFT can be (under certain cases) a fast, performant features extractor for your projects that involve time-dependant data.\nHow to use Principal FFT in Python\nI created a Python package to use Principal FFT, called principal-fft.\npip install principal-fft\nThe class follows the Transformer API from scikit-learn, so it has fit and transform methods.\nfrom principalfft import PrincipalFFT\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nmnist = load_digits()\nX, y = mnist.data, mnist.target\nXfft = PrincipalFFT(n_components=10).fit_transform(X)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\nXfft_train, Xfft_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(Xfft, y, test_size=0.3)\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(50, min_samples_leaf=5).fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(&quot;Raw score&quot;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(50, min_samples_leaf=5).fit(Xfft_train, y_train)\nprint(&quot;FFT score&quot;, clf.score(Xfft_test, y_test))\nMy results are 0.09 for raw data and 0.78 for FFT transformed: quite a big difference!\nAs with any dimensionality reduction, n_components is an hyperparameter you have to tune for your specific project: from my experiments, you shouldn't go lower than 8 to achieve a reasonable accuracy.\nHow to use Principal FFT in C\nSo, now that we tested our Principal FFT transformer in Python and achieved good results, how do we use it on our microcontroller? Of course with the micromlgen porter: it is now (version 1.1.9) able to port PrincipalFFT objects to plain C.\npip install micromlgen==1.1.9\nWhat does the C code look like?\nvoid principalFFT(float *features, float *fft) {\n    // apply principal FFT (naive implementation for the top 10 frequencies only)\n    const int topFrequencies[] = { 0, 8, 17, 16, 1, 9, 2, 7, 15, 6 };\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        const int k = topFrequencies[i];\n        const float harmonic = 0.09817477042468103 * k;\n        float re = 0;\n        float im = 0;\n\n        // optimized case\n        if (k == 0) {\n            for (int n = 0; n &lt; 64; n++) {\n                re += features[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        else {\n            for (int n = 0; n &lt; 64; n++) {\n                const float harmonic_n = harmonic * n;\n                const float cos_n = cos(harmonic_n);\n                const float sin_n = sin(harmonic_n);\n                re += features[n] * cos_n;\n                im -= features[n] * sin_n;\n            }\n        }\n\n        fft[i] = sqrt(re * re + im * im);\n    }\n}\nThis is the most direct porting available.\nIn the Benchmarks section, we'll see how this implementation can be speed-up with alternative implementations.\nBenchmarking\nThe following table reports the benchmark on the MNIST dataset (64 features) with 10 principal FFT components vs various tecniques to decrease the computation time at the expense of memory usage.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nFlash (Kb)\nExecution time (micros)\n\n\n\n\nNone\n137420\n-\n\n\narduinoFFT library\n147812\n3200\n\n\nprincipalFFT\n151404\n4400\n\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos+sin LUT\n152124\n900\n\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos LUT + sin sign LUT\n150220\n1250\n\n\n\n*all the benchmarks were run on the Arduino 33 Nano BLE Sense\nSome thoughts:\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos+sin LUT means I pre-compute the values of sin and cos at compile time, so there's no computation on the board; of course these lookup tables will eat some memory\nprincipalFFT w/ cos LUT + sin sign LUT means I pre-compute the cos values only and compute sin using sqrt(1 - cos(x)^2); it adds some microseconds to the computation, but requires less memory\narduinoFFT library is faster than principalFFT in the execution time and requires less memory, even if principalFFT is only computing 10 frequencies: I need to investigate how it can achieve such performances\n\nYou can activate the LUT functionality with:\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom principalfft import PrincipalFFT\n\nfft = PrincipalFFT(n_components=10).fit(X)\n\n# cos lookup, sin computed\nport(fft, lookup_cos=True)\n\n# cos + sin lookup\nport(fft, lookup_cos=True, lookup_sin=True)\nHere's how the C code looks like with LUT.\nvoid principalFFT(float *features, float *fft) {\n    // apply principal FFT (naive implementation for the top N frequencies only)\n    const int topFrequencies[] = { 0, 8, 17, 16, 1, 9, 2, 7, 15, 6 };\n    const float cosLUT[10][64] = {\n        {  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0},\n        {  1.0,  0.7071,  6.1232e-17,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -1.8369e-16,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  3.0616e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -4.2862e-16,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  5.5109e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.4499e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -9.8033e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.6948e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -7.3540e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.9397e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -4.9047e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.1847e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -2.4554e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.4296e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -6.1898e-19,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.6745e-15,  0.7071},   ... };\n    const bool sinLUT[10][64] = {\n        {  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false},\n        {  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false},  ...};\n\n    for (int i = 0;

Capture audio samples</h2>\n<p>First of all, we need to capture a bunch of examples of the words we want to recognize.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/2019/12/word-classification-using-arduino/\">original post</a>, we used an analog microphone to record the audio. It is for sure the easiest way to interact with audio on a microcontroller since you only need to <code>analogRead()</code> the selected pin to get a value from the sensor.</p>\n<p>This semplicity, however, comes at the cost of a nearly inexistent signal pre-processing from the sensor itself: most of the time, you will get junk - I don't want to be rude, but that's it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toctheory-pulse-density-modulation-a-k-a-pdm\">Theory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)</h3>\n<p>The microphone mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (the <a href=\"https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Nano_BLE_Sense_mp34dt05-a.pdf\">MP34DT05</a>) is fortunately much better than this: it gives you access to a modulated signal much more suitable for our processing needs.</p>\n<p>The modulation used is pulse-density: I won't try to explain you how this works since I'm not an expert in DSP and neither it is the main scope of this article (refer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation\">Wikipedia</a> for some more information).</p>\n<p>What matters to us is that we can grab an array of bytes from the microphone and extract its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square\">Root Mean Square</a> (a.k.a. RMS) to be used as a feature for our Machine Learning model.</p>\n<p>I had some difficulty finding examples on how to access the microphone on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board: fortunately, there's a <a href=\"https://github.com/DaleGia/nano-33-sense-serial-example\">Github repo</a> from <em>DelaGia</em> that shows how to access all the sensors of the board.</p>\n<p>I extracted the microphone part and incapsulated it in an easy to use class, so you don't really need to dig into the implementation details if you're not interested.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocpractice-the-code-to-capture-the-samples\">Practice: the code to capture the samples</h3>\n<p>When loaded on your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, the following sketch will await for you to speak in front of the microphone: once it detects a sound, it will record  64 audio values and print them to the serial monitor.</p>\n<p>From my experience, 64 samples are sufficient to cover short words such as <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>stop</em>: if you plan to classify longer words, you may need to increase this number.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">I suggest you keep the words short: longer words will probably decrease the accuracy of the model. If you want nonetheless a longer duration, at least keep the number of words as low as possible</div>\n<p>Download the <a href=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arduino-33-ble-sense-capture-audio-samples.zip\" title=\"Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples\">Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples sketch</a>, open it the Arduino IDE and flash it to your board.</p>\n<p>Here's the main code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &quot;Mic.h&quot;\n\n// tune as per your needs\n#define SAMPLES 64\n#define GAIN (1.0f/50)\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 2000\n\nfloat features[SAMPLES];\nMic mic;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    PDM.onReceive(onAudio);\n    mic.begin();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // await for a word to be pronounced\n    if (recordAudioSample()) {\n        // print features to serial monitor\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            Serial.print(features[i], 6);\n            Serial.print(i == SAMPLES - 1 ? &#039;\\n&#039; : &#039;,&#039;);\n        }\n\n        delay(1000);\n    }\n\n    delay(20);\n}\n\n/**\n * PDM callback to update mic object\n */\nvoid onAudio() {\n    mic.update();\n}\n\n/**\n * Read given number of samples from mic\n */\nbool recordAudioSample() {\n    if (mic.hasData() &amp;&amp; mic.data() &gt; SOUND_THRESHOLD) {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            while (!mic.hasData())\n                delay(1);\n\n            features[i] = mic.pop() * GAIN;\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have the acquisition logic in place, it's time for you to record some samples of the words you want to classify. </p>\n<h3 id=\"tocaction-capture-the-words-examples\">Action: capture the words examples</h3>\n<p>Now you have to capture as many samples of the words you want to classify as possible.</p>\n<p>Open the serial monitor and pronounce a word near the microphone: a line of numbers will be printed on the monitor.</p>\n<p>This is the <em>description</em> of your word.</p>\n<p>You need many lines like this for an accurate prediction, so keep repeating the same word 15-30 times.</p>\n<div class=\"my-advice\">**My advice**: while recording the samples, vary both the distance of your mounth from the mic and the intensity of your voice: this will produce a more robust classification model later on.</div>\n<p>After you repeated the same words many times, copy the content of the serial monitor and save it in a CSV file named after the word, for example <code>yes.csv</code>.</p>\n<p>Then clear the serial monitor and repeat the process for each word.</p>\n<p>Keep all these files in a folder because we need them to train our classifier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocstep-2-train-the-machine-learning-model\">Step 2. Train the machine learning model</h2>\n<p>Now that we have the samples, it's time to train the classifier.</p>\n<p>Create a Python project in your favourite IDE or use your favourite text editor, if you don't have one.</p>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"/2019/11/how-to-train-a-classifier-in-scikit-learn/\">my post about how to train a classifier</a>, we create a Python script that reads all the files inside a folder and concatenates them in a single array you feed to the classifier model.</p>\n<p>Be sure your folder structure is like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>ArduinoWordClassification\n  |-- train_classifier.py\n  |-- data/\n  |---- yes.csv\n  |---- no.csv\n  |---- play.csv\n  |---- any other .csv file you recorded</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># file: train_classifier.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndef load_features(folder):\n    dataset = None\n    classmap = {}\n    for class_idx, filename in enumerate(glob(&#039;%s/*.csv&#039; % folder)):\n        class_name = basename(filename)[:-4]\n        classmap[class_idx] = class_name\n        samples = np.loadtxt(filename, dtype=float, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)\n        labels = np.ones((len(samples), 1)) * class_idx\n        samples = np.hstack((samples, labels))\n        dataset = samples if dataset is None else np.vstack((dataset, samples))\n    return dataset, classmap\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\ndataset, classmap = load_features(&#039;data&#039;)\nX, y = dataset[:, :-1], dataset[:, -1]\n# this line is for testing your accuracy only: once you&#039;re satisfied with the results, set test_size to 1\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nclf = SVC(kernel=&#039;poly&#039;, degree=2, gamma=0.1, C=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(&#039;Accuracy&#039;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\nprint(&#039;Exported classifier to plain C&#039;)\nprint(port(clf, classmap=classmap))</code></pre>\n<p>Among the classifiers I tried, SVM produced the best accuracy at 96% with 32 support vectors: it's not a super-tiny model, but it's quite small nevertheless.</p>\n<p>If you're not satisifed with SVM, you can use Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Relevant Vector Machines.

            "content_text": "Let's revamp the post I wrote about word classification using Machine Learning on Arduino, this time using a proper microphone (the MP34DT05 mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense) instead of a chinese, analog one: will the results improve?\nfrom https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-audio-processing-complete-engineers-course/\n\nUpdated on 16 October 2020: step by step explanation of the process with ready-made sketch code\nTable of contentsWhat you'll learnWhat you'll needStep 1. Capture audio samplesTheory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)Practice: the code to capture the samplesAction: capture the words examplesStep 2. Train the machine learning modelStep 3. Deploy to your microcontroller\nWhat you'll learn\nThis tutorial will teach you how to capture audio from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microphone and classify it: at the end of this post, you will have a trained model able to detect in real-time the word you tell, among the ones that you trained it to recognize. The classification will occur directly on your Arduino board.\nThis is not a general-purpose speech recognizer able to convert speech-to-text: it works only on the words you train it on.\nWhat you'll need\n\n\nHardware\n\nArduino Nano 33 BLE Sense\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\nPython\nPython's module scikit-learn\nPython's module micromlgen\n\n\n\nTo install the software, open your terminal and install the libraries.\npip install -U scikit-learn\npip install -U micromlgen\nStep 1. Capture audio samples\nFirst of all, we need to capture a bunch of examples of the words we want to recognize.\nIn the original post, we used an analog microphone to record the audio. It is for sure the easiest way to interact with audio on a microcontroller since you only need to analogRead() the selected pin to get a value from the sensor.\nThis semplicity, however, comes at the cost of a nearly inexistent signal pre-processing from the sensor itself: most of the time, you will get junk - I don't want to be rude, but that's it.\nTheory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)\nThe microphone mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (the MP34DT05) is fortunately much better than this: it gives you access to a modulated signal much more suitable for our processing needs.\nThe modulation used is pulse-density: I won't try to explain you how this works since I'm not an expert in DSP and neither it is the main scope of this article (refer to Wikipedia for some more information).\nWhat matters to us is that we can grab an array of bytes from the microphone and extract its Root Mean Square (a.k.a. RMS) to be used as a feature for our Machine Learning model.\nI had some difficulty finding examples on how to access the microphone on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board: fortunately, there's a Github repo from DelaGia that shows how to access all the sensors of the board.\nI extracted the microphone part and incapsulated it in an easy to use class, so you don't really need to dig into the implementation details if you're not interested.\nPractice: the code to capture the samples\nWhen loaded on your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, the following sketch will await for you to speak in front of the microphone: once it detects a sound, it will record  64 audio values and print them to the serial monitor.\nFrom my experience, 64 samples are sufficient to cover short words such as yes, no, play, stop: if you plan to classify longer words, you may need to increase this number.\nI suggest you keep the words short: longer words will probably decrease the accuracy of the model. If you want nonetheless a longer duration, at least keep the number of words as low as possible\nDownload the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples sketch, open it the Arduino IDE and flash it to your board.\nHere's the main code.\n#include &quot;Mic.h&quot;\n\n// tune as per your needs\n#define SAMPLES 64\n#define GAIN (1.0f/50)\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 2000\n\nfloat features[SAMPLES];\nMic mic;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    PDM.onReceive(onAudio);\n    mic.begin();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // await for a word to be pronounced\n    if (recordAudioSample()) {\n        // print features to serial monitor\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            Serial.print(features[i], 6);\n            Serial.print(i == SAMPLES - 1 ? &#039;\\n&#039; : &#039;,&#039;);\n        }\n\n        delay(1000);\n    }\n\n    delay(20);\n}\n\n/**\n * PDM callback to update mic object\n */\nvoid onAudio() {\n    mic.update();\n}\n\n/**\n * Read given number of samples from mic\n */\nbool recordAudioSample() {\n    if (mic.hasData() &amp;&amp; mic.data() &gt; SOUND_THRESHOLD) {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            while (!mic.hasData())\n                delay(1);\n\n            features[i] = mic.pop() * GAIN;\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\nNow that we have the acquisition logic in place, it's time for you to record some samples of the words you want to classify. \nAction: capture the words examples\nNow you have to capture as many samples of the words you want to classify as possible.\nOpen the serial monitor and pronounce a word near the microphone: a line of numbers will be printed on the monitor.\nThis is the description of your word.\nYou need many lines like this for an accurate prediction, so keep repeating the same word 15-30 times.\n**My advice**: while recording the samples, vary both the distance of your mounth from the mic and the intensity of your voice: this will produce a more robust classification model later on.\nAfter you repeated the same words many times, copy the content of the serial monitor and save it in a CSV file named after the word, for example yes.csv.\nThen clear the serial monitor and repeat the process for each word.\nKeep all these files in a folder because we need them to train our classifier.\nStep 2. Train the machine learning model\nNow that we have the samples, it's time to train the classifier.\nCreate a Python project in your favourite IDE or use your favourite text editor, if you don't have one.\nAs described in my post about how to train a classifier, we create a Python script that reads all the files inside a folder and concatenates them in a single array you feed to the classifier model.\nBe sure your folder structure is like the following:\nArduinoWordClassification\n  |-- train_classifier.py\n  |-- data/\n  |---- yes.csv\n  |---- no.csv\n  |---- play.csv\n  |---- any other .csv file you recorded\n# file: train_classifier.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndef load_features(folder):\n    dataset = None\n    classmap = {}\n    for class_idx, filename in enumerate(glob(&#039;%s/*.csv&#039; % folder)):\n        class_name = basename(filename)[:-4]\n        classmap[class_idx] = class_name\n        samples = np.loadtxt(filename, dtype=float, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)\n        labels = np.ones((len(samples), 1)) * class_idx\n        samples = np.hstack((samples, labels))\n        dataset = samples if dataset is None else np.vstack((dataset, samples))\n    return dataset, classmap\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\ndataset, classmap = load_features(&#039;data&#039;)\nX, y = dataset[:, :-1], dataset[:, -1]\n# this line is for testing your accuracy only: once you&#039;re satisfied with the results, set test_size to 1\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nclf = SVC(kernel=&#039;poly&#039;, degree=2, gamma=0.1, C=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(&#039;Accuracy&#039;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\nprint(&#039;Exported classifier to plain C&#039;)\nprint(port(clf, classmap=classmap))\nAmong the classifiers I tried, SVM produced the best accuracy at 96% with 32 support vectors: it's not a super-tiny model, but it's quite small nevertheless.\nIf you're not satisifed with SVM, you can use Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Relevant Vector Machines. See my other posts for a detailed description of each.\nIn your console, after the accuracy score, you will have the plain C implementation of the classifier you trained.

And thanks to EloquentML you can now port it to your microcontroller.\n\n\n(Gaussian) Naive Bayes\nNaive Bayes classifiers are simple models based on the probability theory that can be used for classification.\nThey originate from the assumption of independence among the input variables. Even though this assumption doesn't hold true in the vast majority of the cases, they often perform very good at many classification tasks, so they're quite popular.\nGaussian Naive Bayes stack another (mostly wrong) assumption: that the variables exhibit a Gaussian probability distribution.\nI (and many others like me) will never understand how it is possible that so many wrong assumptions lead to such good performances!\nNevertheless, what is important to us is that sklearn implements GaussianNB, so we easily train such a classifier.\nThe most interesting part is that GaussianNB can be tuned with just a single parameter: var_smoothing.\nDon't ask me what it does in theory: in practice you change it and your accuracy can boost. This leads to an easy tuning process that doesn't involves expensive grid search.\nimport sklearn.datasets as d\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import normalize\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\ndef pick_best(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):\n    best = (None, 0)\n    for var_smoothing in range(-7, 1):\n        clf = GaussianNB(var_smoothing=pow(10, var_smoothing))\n        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n        accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).sum()\n        if accuracy &gt; best[1]:\n            best = (clf, accuracy)\n    print(&#039;best accuracy&#039;, best[1] / len(y_test))\n    return best[0]\n\niris = d.load_iris()\nX = normalize(iris.data)\ny = iris.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\nclf = pick_best(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)\nThis simple procedure will train a bunch of classifiers with a different var_smoothing factor and pick the best performing one.\nEloquentML integration\nOnce you have your trained classifier, porting it to C is as easy as always:\nfrom micromlgen import port\n\nclf = pick_best()\nprint(port(clf))\nAlways remember to run \npip install --upgrade micromlgen\n\nport is a magic method able to port many classifiers: it will automatically detect the proper converter for you.\nWhat does the exported code looks like?\n#pragma once\nnamespace Eloquent {\n    namespace ML {\n        namespace Port {\n            class GaussianNB {\n                public:\n                    /**\n                    * Predict class for features vector\n                    */\n                    int predict(float *x) {\n                        float votes[3] = { 0.0f };\n                        float theta[4] = { 0 };\n                        float sigma[4] = { 0 };\n                        theta[0] = 0.801139789889; theta[1] = 0.54726920354; theta[2] = 0.234408773313; theta[3] = 0.039178084094;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000366881742; sigma[1] = 0.000907992556; sigma[2] = 0.000740960787; sigma[3] = 0.000274925514;\n                        votes[0] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        theta[0] = 0.748563871324; theta[1] = 0.349390892644; theta[2] = 0.536186138345; theta[3] = 0.166747384117;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000529727082; sigma[1] = 0.000847956504; sigma[2] = 0.000690057342; sigma[3] = 0.000311828658;\n                        votes[1] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        theta[0] = 0.704497203305; theta[1] = 0.318862439835; theta[2] = 0.593755956917; theta[3] = 0.217288784452;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000363782089; sigma[1] = 0.000813846722; sigma[2] = 0.000415475678; sigma[3] = 0.000758478249;\n                        votes[2] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        // return argmax of votes\n                        uint8_t classIdx = 0;\n                        float maxVotes = votes[0];\n\n                        for (uint8_t i = 1; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n                            if (votes[i] &gt; maxVotes) {\n                                classIdx = i;\n                                maxVotes = votes[i];\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        return classIdx;\n                    }\n\n                protected:\n                    /**\n                    * Compute gaussian value\n                    */\n                    float gauss(float *x, float *theta, float *sigma) {\n                        float gauss = 0.0f;\n\n                        for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {\n                            gauss += log(sigma[i]);\n                            gauss += pow(x[i] - theta[i], 2) / sigma[i];\n                        }\n\n                        return gauss;\n                    }\n                };\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAs you can see, we need a couple of &quot;weight vectors&quot;:\n\ntheta is the mean of each feature\nsigma is the standard deviation\n\nThe computation is quite thin: just a couple of operations; the class with the highest score is then selected.\nBenchmarks\nFollowing there's a recap of a couple benchmarks I run on an Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense.\n\n\n\nClassifier\nDataset\nFlash\nRAM\nExecution time\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nGaussianNB\nIris (150x4)\n82 kb\n42 Kb\n65 ms\n97%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nIris (150x4)\n83 Kb\n42 Kb\n76 ms\n99%\n\n\nGaussianNB\nBreast cancer (80x40)\n90 Kb\n42 Kb\n160 ms\n77%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nBreast cancer (80x40)\n112 Kb\n42 Kb\n378 ms\n73%\n\n\nGaussianNB\nWine (100x13)\n85 Kb\n42 Kb\n130 ms\n97%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nWine (100x13)\n89 Kb\n42 Kb\n125 ms\n99%\n\n\n\nWe can see that the accuracy is on par with a linear SVM, reaching up to 97% on some datasets.

It will be the first component of a larger project I'm going to implement.\n\nIf you Google &quot;esp32 video streaming&quot; you will get a bunch of results that are essentialy copy-pasted from the official Espressif repo: many of them neither copy-pasted the code, just tell you to load the example sketch.\nAnd if you try to read it and try to modify just a bit for your own use-case, you won't understand much.\nThis is the exact environment for an Eloquent component to live: make it painfully easy what's messy.\nI still have to find a good naming scheme for my libraries since Arduino IDE doesn't allow nested imports, so forgive me if &quot;ESP32CameraHTTPVideoStreamingServer.h&quot; was the best that came to mind.\nHow easy is it to use?\n1 line of code if used in conjuction with my other library EloquentVision.\n#define CAMERA_MODEL_M5STACK_WIDE\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n#include &quot;EloquentVision.h&quot;\n#include &quot;ESP32CameraHTTPVideoStreamingServer.h&quot;\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::Camera;\n\nESP32Camera camera;\nHTTPVideoStreamingServer server(81);\n\n/**\n *\n */\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.softAP(&quot;ESP32&quot;, &quot;12345678&quot;);\n\n    camera.begin(FRAMESIZE_QVGA, PIXFORMAT_JPEG);\n    server.start();\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Camera Ready! Use &#039;http://&quot;);\n    Serial.print(WiFi.softAPIP());\n    Serial.println(&quot;:81&#039; to stream&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n}\nHTTPVideoStreamingServer assumes you already initialized your camera. You can achieve this task in the way you prefer: ESP32Camera class makes this a breeze.\n81 in the server constructor is the port you want the server to be listening to.\nOnce connected to WiFi or started in AP mode, all you have to do is call start(): that's it!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWhat else is it good for?\nThe main reason I wrote this piece of library is because one of you reader commented on the motion detection post asking if it would be possible to start the video streaming once motion is detected.\nOf course it is.\nIt's just a matter of composing the Eloquent pieces.\n#define CAMERA_MODEL_M5STACK_WIDE\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n#include &quot;EloquentVision.h&quot;\n#include &quot;ESP32CameraHTTPVideoStreamingServer.h&quot;\n\n#define SOURCE_WIDTH 320\n#define SOURCE_HEIGHT 240\n#define BLOCK_SIZE 10\n#define BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.2\n#define IMAGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.1\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::Camera;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::ImageProcessing;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::ImageProcessing::Downscale;\n\nESP32Camera camera;\nHTTPVideoStreamingServer server(81);\nMotionDetection&lt; SOURCE_WIDTH, SOURCE_HEIGHT, BLOCK_SIZE&gt; motion(nearest);\n\n/**\n *\n */\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.softAP(&quot;ESP32&quot;, &quot;12345678&quot;);\n\n    camera.begin(FRAMESIZE_QVGA, PIXFORMAT_JPEG);\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Camera Ready!

Save the contents to a file (I named it pca.h) in the same folder of your .ino project and include it.\n#include &quot;pca.h&quot;\n\n// this was trained on the IRIS dataset, with 2 principal components\nEloquent::ML::Port::PCA pca;\nThe pca object is now able to take an array of size N as input and return an array of size K as output, with K &lt; N usually.\nvoid setup() {\n    float x_input[4] = {5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2};\n    float x_output[2];\n\n    pca.transform(x_input, x_output);\n}\nThat's it: now you can run your classifier on x_output.\n#include &quot;pca.h&quot;\n#include &quot;svm.h&quot;\n\nEloquent::ML::Port::PCA pca;\nEloquent::ML::Port::SVM clf;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    float x_input[4] = {5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2};\n    float x_output[2];\n    int y_pred;\n\n    pca.transform(x_input, x_output);\n\n    y_pred = clf.predict(x_output);\n}\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA real world example\nAs I anticipated, let's take a look at how PCA dimensionality reduction can help in fitting classifiers that would otherwise be too large to fit on our microcontrollers.\nThis is the exact table from the Gesture classification project.\n\n\n\nKernel\nC\nGamma\nDegree\nVectors\nFlash size\nRAM (b)\nAvg accuracy\n\n\n\n\nRBF\n10\n0.001\n-\n37\n53 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n2\n12\n25 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n3\n25\n40 Kb\n1228\n97%\n\n\nLinear\n50\n-\n1\n40\n55 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\nRBF\n100\n0.01\n-\n61\n80 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\n\nThe dataset has 90 features (30 samples x 3 axes) and achieves 99% accuracy. \nLet's pick the poly kernel with degree 2 and see how much we can decrease the number of components while still achieving a good accuracy.\n\n\n\nPCA components\nAccuracy\nSupport vectors\n\n\n\n\n90\n99%\n31\n\n\n50\n99%\n31\n\n\n40\n99%\n31\n\n\n30\n90%\n30\n\n\n20\n90%\n28\n\n\n15\n90%\n24\n\n\n10\n99%\n18\n\n\n5\n76%\n28\n\n\n\nWe clearly see a couple of things:\n\nwe still achieve 99% accuracy even with only 40 out of 90 principal components\nwe get a satisfactory 90% accuracy even with only 15 components\n(this is a bit unexpected) it looks like there's a sweet spot at 10 components where the accuracy skyrockets to 99% again. This could be just a contingency of this particular dataset, don't expect to replicate this results on your own dataset\n\nWhat do these numbers mean to you? It means your board has to do many less computations to give you a prediction and will probably be able to host a more complex model.\nLet's check out the figures with n_components = 10 compared with the ones without PCA.\n\n\n\nKernel\nPCA support vectors\nPCA flash size\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nRBF C=10\n46 (+24%)\n32 Kb (-40%)\n99%\n\n\nRBF C=100\n28 (-54%)\n32 Kb (-60%)\n99%\n\n\nPoly 2\n13 (-48%)\n28 Kb (+12%)\n99%\n\n\nPoly 3\n24 (-4%)\n32 Kb (-20%)\n99%\n\n\nLinear\n18 (-64%)\n29 Kb (-47%)\n99%\n\n\n\nA couple notes:\n\naccuracy increased (on stayed the same) for all kernels\nwith one exception, flash size decreased in the range 20 - 50%\nnow we can fit 3 classifiers on our Arduino UNO instead of only one\n\nI will probably spend some more time investingating the usefulness of PCA for Arduino Machine Learning projects, but for now that's it: it's a good starting point in my opinion.\n\nThere's a little example sketch on Github that applies PCA to the IRIS dataset.\nTell me what you think may be a clever application of dimensionality reduction in the world of microcontrollers and see if we can build something great together.\nL'articolo Arduino dimensionality reduction (PCA) for Machine Learning projects proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

So he asked for a better alternative.</p>\n<p>Since the post was of great interest for many people, I took the time to revisit the code and make improvements.</p>\n<p>I came up with a 100% re-writing that is both easier to use and faster. Actually, it is <strong>blazing fast!</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let's see how it works.</p>\n<p><div class=\"toc\"><h6>Table of contents</h6><ol><li><a href=\"#tocdownsampling\">Downsampling</a><ol><li><a href=\"#tocnearest-neighbor\">Nearest neighbor</a><li><a href=\"#tocfull-block-average\">Full block average</a><li><a href=\"#toccore-block-average\">Core block average</a><li><a href=\"#toccross-block-average\">Cross block average</a><li><a href=\"#tocdiagonal-block-average\">Diagonal block average</a><li><a href=\"#tocimplement-your-own\">Implement your own</a></li></ol><li><a href=\"#tocbenchmarks\">Benchmarks</a><li><a href=\"#tocmotion-detection\">Motion detection</a><li><a href=\"#tocfull-code\">Full code</a></ol></div></p>\n<h2 id=\"tocdownsampling\">Downsampling</h2>\n<p>In the original post I introduced the idea of downsampling the image from the camera for a faster and more robust motion detection. I wrote the code in the main sketch to keep it self-contained.</p>\n<p>Looking back now it was a poor choice, since it cluttered the project and distracted from the main purpose, which is motion detection.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I thought that scanning the image buffer in sequential order would be the fastest approach.</p>\n<p>It turns out I was wrong.</p>\n<p>This time I scan the image buffer following the blocks that will compose the resulting image and the results are... much faster.</p>\n<p>Also, I decided to inject some more efficiency that will further speedup the computation: using different strategies for downsampling.</p>\n<p>The idea of downsampling is that you have to &quot;collapse&quot; a block of NxN from the original image to just one pixel of the resulting image.</p>\n<p>Now, there are a variety of ways you can accomplish this. The first two I present here are the most obvious, the other two are of my &quot;invention&quot;: nothing fancy nor new, but they're fast and serve the purpose well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocnearest-neighbor\">Nearest neighbor</h3>\n<p>You can just pick the center of the NxN block and use its value for the output.<br />\nOf course it is fast (possibly the fastest approach), but wouldn't be very accurate. One pixel out of NxN wouldn't be representative of the overall region and will heavily suffer from noise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nearest-diagram.png\" alt=\"Nearest diagram\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nn.jpg\" alt=\"Nearest neighbor block averaging\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"tocfull-block-average\">Full block average</h3>\n<p>This is the most intuitive alternative: use the average of all the pixels in the block as the ouput value. This is arguabily the &quot;proper&quot; way to do it, since you're using all the pixels in the source image to compute the new one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Full-diagram.png\" alt=\"Full diagram\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/full.jpg\" alt=\"Full block averaging\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"toccore-block-average\">Core block average</h3>\n<p>As a faster alternative, I thought that averaging only the &quot;core&quot; (the most internal part) of the block would have been a good-enough solution. It has no theoretical proof that this yields true, but our task here is to create a smaller <em>representation</em> of the original image, not producing an accurate smaller version.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Core-diagram.png\" alt=\"Core diagram\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/core.jpg\" alt=\"Core block averaging\" /></p>\n<p><em>I'll stress this point: the only reason we do downsampling is to compare two sequential frame and detect if they differ above a certain threshold. This downsampling doesn't have to mimic the actual image: it can transform the source in any fancy way, as long as it stays consistent and captures the variations over time.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"toccross-block-average\">Cross block average</h3>\n<p>This time we consider all the pixels along the vertical and horizontal central axes. The idea is that you will capture a good portion of the variation along both the axis, given quite accurate results.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cross-diagram.png\" alt=\"Cross diagram\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cross.jpg\" alt=\"Cross block averaging\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"tocdiagonal-block-average\">Diagonal block average</h3>\n<p>This alternative too came to my mind from nowhere, really. I just think it is a good alternative to capture all the block's variation, probably even better than vertical and horizontal directions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Diagonal-diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagonal diagram\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/diagonal.jpg\" alt=\"Diagonal block averaging\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"tocimplement-your-own\">Implement your own</h3>\n<p>Not satisfied from the methods above?

            "content_text": "If you liked my post about ESP32 cam motion detection, you'll love this updated version: it's easier to use and blazing fast!\n\n\nThe post about pure video ESP32 cam motion detection without an external PIR is my most successful post at the moment. Many of you are interested about this topic.\nOne of my readers, though, pointed out my implementation was quite slow and he only achieved bare 5 fps in his project. So he asked for a better alternative.\nSince the post was of great interest for many people, I took the time to revisit the code and make improvements.\nI came up with a 100% re-writing that is both easier to use and faster. Actually, it is blazing fast!.\nLet's see how it works.\nTable of contentsDownsamplingNearest neighborFull block averageCore block averageCross block averageDiagonal block averageImplement your ownBenchmarksMotion detectionFull code\nDownsampling\nIn the original post I introduced the idea of downsampling the image from the camera for a faster and more robust motion detection. I wrote the code in the main sketch to keep it self-contained.\nLooking back now it was a poor choice, since it cluttered the project and distracted from the main purpose, which is motion detection.\nMoreover, I thought that scanning the image buffer in sequential order would be the fastest approach.\nIt turns out I was wrong.\nThis time I scan the image buffer following the blocks that will compose the resulting image and the results are... much faster.\nAlso, I decided to inject some more efficiency that will further speedup the computation: using different strategies for downsampling.\nThe idea of downsampling is that you have to &quot;collapse&quot; a block of NxN from the original image to just one pixel of the resulting image.\nNow, there are a variety of ways you can accomplish this. The first two I present here are the most obvious, the other two are of my &quot;invention&quot;: nothing fancy nor new, but they're fast and serve the purpose well.\nNearest neighbor\nYou can just pick the center of the NxN block and use its value for the output.\nOf course it is fast (possibly the fastest approach), but wouldn't be very accurate. One pixel out of NxN wouldn't be representative of the overall region and will heavily suffer from noise.\n\n\nFull block average\nThis is the most intuitive alternative: use the average of all the pixels in the block as the ouput value. This is arguabily the &quot;proper&quot; way to do it, since you're using all the pixels in the source image to compute the new one.\n\n\nCore block average\nAs a faster alternative, I thought that averaging only the &quot;core&quot; (the most internal part) of the block would have been a good-enough solution. It has no theoretical proof that this yields true, but our task here is to create a smaller representation of the original image, not producing an accurate smaller version.\n\n\nI'll stress this point: the only reason we do downsampling is to compare two sequential frame and detect if they differ above a certain threshold. This downsampling doesn't have to mimic the actual image: it can transform the source in any fancy way, as long as it stays consistent and captures the variations over time.\nCross block average\nThis time we consider all the pixels along the vertical and horizontal central axes. The idea is that you will capture a good portion of the variation along both the axis, given quite accurate results.\n\n\nDiagonal block average\nThis alternative too came to my mind from nowhere, really. I just think it is a good alternative to capture all the block's variation, probably even better than vertical and horizontal directions.\n\n\nImplement your own\nNot satisfied from the methods above? No problem, you can still implement your own.\nThe ones presented above are just some algorithms that came to my mind: I'm not telling you they're the best.\nThey worked for me, that's it.\nIf you think you found a better solution, I encourage you implement it and even share it with me and the other readers, so we can all make progress on this together.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nBenchmarks\nSo, at the very beginning I said this new implementation is blazingly fast. \nHow much fast?\nAs fast as it can be, arguably.\nI mean, so fast it won't alter your fps.\nLook at the results I got on my M5Stack camera.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nTime to execute (micros)\nFPS\n\n\n\n\nNone\n0\n25\n\n\nNearest neighbor\n160\n25\n\n\nCross block\n700\n25\n\n\nCore block\n800\n25\n\n\nDiagonal block\n950\n25\n\n\nFull block\n4900\n12\n\n\n\nAs you can see, only the full block creates a delay in the process (quite a bit of delay even): the other  methods  won't slow down your program in any noticeable way.\nIf you test Nearest neighbor and it works for you, then you'll be extremely light on computation resources with only 160 microseconds of delay.\nThis is what I mean by blazing fast.\nMotion detection\nThe motion detection part hasn't changed, so I point you to the original post to read more about the Block difference threshold and the Image difference threshold.\nFull code\n#define CAMERA_MODEL_M5STACK_WIDE\n#include &quot;EloquentVision.h&quot;\n\n#define FRAME_SIZE FRAMESIZE_QVGA\n#define SOURCE_WIDTH 320\n#define SOURCE_HEIGHT 240\n#define BLOCK_SIZE 10\n#define DEST_WIDTH (SOURCE_WIDTH / BLOCK_SIZE)\n#define DEST_HEIGHT (SOURCE_HEIGHT / BLOCK_SIZE)\n#define BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.2\n#define IMAGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.1\n#define DEBUG 0\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision;\n\nESP32Camera camera;\nuint8_t prevFrame[DEST_WIDTH * DEST_HEIGHT] = { 0 };\nuint8_t currentFrame[DEST_WIDTH * DEST_HEIGHT] = { 0 };\n\n// function prototypes\nbool motionDetect();\nvoid updateFrame();\n\n/**\n *\n */\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    camera.begin(FRAME_SIZE, PIXFORMAT_GRAYSCALE);\n}\n\n/**\n *\n */\nvoid loop() {\n    /**\n     * Algorithm:\n     *  1. grab frame\n     *  2. compare with previous to detect motion\n     *  3. update previous frame\n     */\n\n    time_t start = millis();\n    camera_fb_t *frame = camera.capture();\n\n    downscaleImage(frame-&gt;buf, currentFrame, nearest, SOURCE_WIDTH, SOURCE_HEIGHT, BLOCK_SIZE);\n\n    if (motionDetect()) {\n        Serial.print(&quot;Motion detected @ &quot;);\n        Serial.print(floor(1000.0f / (millis() - start)));\n        Serial.println(&quot; FPS&quot;);\n    }\n\n    updateFrame();\n}\n\n/**\n * Compute the number of different blocks\n * If there are enough, then motion happened\n */\nbool motionDetect() {\n    uint16_t changes = 0;\n    const uint16_t blocks = DEST_WIDTH * DEST_HEIGHT;\n\n    for (int y = 0; y &lt; DEST_HEIGHT; y++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x &lt; DEST_WIDTH; x++) {\n            float current = currentFrame[y * DEST_WIDTH + x];\n            float prev = prevFrame[y * DEST_WIDTH + x];\n            float delta = abs(current - prev) / prev;\n\n            if (delta &gt;= BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD)\n                changes += 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return (1.0 * changes / blocks) &gt; IMAGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD;\n}\n\n/**\n * Copy current frame to previous\n */\nvoid updateFrame() {\n    memcpy(prevFrame, currentFrame, DEST_WIDTH * DEST_HEIGHT);\n}\n\nCheck the full project code on Github and remember to star!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nL'articolo Easier, faster pure video ESP32 cam motion detection proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",
