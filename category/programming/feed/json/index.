It can classify the word you speak among the ones you trained it to recognize!!!\n</div>\n<h3>1. Features definition</h3>\n<p>The microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WakeWord-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"from http://arduinolearning.com/code/ky038-microphone-module-and-arduino-example.php\" /></p>\n<p>When working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\">Fourier Transform</a>, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.</p>\n<h3>2. Record sample data</h3>\n<p>First of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Raw-audio.gif\" alt=\"Raw audio stream\" /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}</code></pre>\n<h4>2.1 Translate the raw values</h4>\n<p>For the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. <code>analogRead()</code> is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">int16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) &gt;&gt; 2;\n}</code></pre>\n<h4>2.2 Detect sound</h4>\n<p>As in the <a href=\"/2019/12/how-to-do-gesture-identification-on-arduino/\">tutorial about gesture classification</a>, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.</p>\n<p>To do this, we first record a &quot;background&quot; sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">float backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Background sound level is &quot;);\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>At this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) &gt;= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}</code></pre>\n<h4>2.3 Record the words</h4>\n<p>As for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.<br />\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.</p>\n<p>I made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4>2.4 Fast Fourier Transform</h4>\n<p>Here we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</a>, which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. </p>\n<p>Luckily for us, there exists <a href=\"https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT\">a library</a> for Arduino that does FFT.</p>\n<p>And is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;arduinoFFT.h&gt;\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You don't need to know what the <code>Windowing</code> function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.</p>\n<p>At this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it. You will lose some accuracy, but your model will be smaller.\n</div>\n<h3>3. Train and export the SVM classifier</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a detailed guide refer to the <a href=\"/2019/11/how-to-train-a-classifier-in-scikit-learn\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called <code>model.h</code>.</p>\n<p>In this project on Machine learning we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily.<br />\nAudio is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Decision-boundaries-of-2-PCA-components-of-Word-classification-linear-kernel-87-accuracy.png\" alt=\"Decision boundaries of 2 PCA components of Word classification, linear kernel\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Decision-boundaries-of-2-PCA-components-of-Word-classification-poly-3-kernel-91-accuracy.png\" alt=\"Decision boundaries of 2 PCA components of Word classification, poly-3 kernel\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Decision-boundaries-of-2-PCA-components-of-Word-classification-rbf-kernel-94-accuracy.png\" alt=\"Decision boundaries of 2 PCA components of Word classification, rbf kernel\" /></p>\n<h4>Select a suitable model</h4>\n<p>Here's an overview table of the 3 tests I did.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kernel</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">No. support vectors</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Avg. accuracy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Linear</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">22</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">87%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poly 3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">29</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">91%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RBF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">36</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">94%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Of course the one with the RBF kernel would be the most desiderable since it has a very high accuracy: 36 support vectors, tough, will produce a model too large to fit on an Arduino Nano.</p>\n<p>So you're forced to pick the one with the highest accuracy that fit on your board: in my case it was the Linear kernel one.</p>\n<h3>3.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning tutorial we're going to use a microphone to identify the word you speak.\nThis is going to run on an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nThis tutorial is part of a series of tutorials about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:\r\n\r\n  define the features\r\n  record sample data: repeat each word a few times and save the values from the serial monitor to a file, one for each word\r\n train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using micromlgen\r\n copy and paste the generated code in a model.h file in the Arduino project and call predict() from it\r\n\nIn this project the features are going to be the Fast Fourier Transform of 50 analog readings from a microphone, taken starting from when a loud sound is detected, sampled at intervals of 5 millis.\n\nThis tutorial is not about \"Wake word\" detection: it can't distinguish a known word from any other word. It can classify the word you speak among the ones you trained it to recognize!!!\n\n1. Features definition\nThe microphone we're going to use is a super simple device: it produces an analog signal (0-1024) based on the sound it detects. \n\nWhen working with audio you almost always don't want to use raw readings, since they're hardly useful. Instead you often go with Fourier Transform, which extracts the frequency information from a time signal. That's going to become our features vector: let's see how in the next step.\n2. Record sample data\nFirst of all, we start with raw audio data. The following plot is me saying random words.\n\n#define MIC A0\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    Serial.println(analogRead(MIC));\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n}\n2.1 Translate the raw values\nFor the Fourier Transform to work, we need to provide as input an array of values both positive and negative. analogRead() is returning only positive values, tough, so we need to translate them.\nint16_t readMic() {\n    // this translated the analog value to a proper interval\n    return  (analogRead(MIC) - 512) &gt;&gt; 2;\n}\n2.2 Detect sound\nAs in the tutorial about gesture classification, we'll start recording the features when a word is beginning to be pronounced. Also in this project we'll use a threshold to detect the start of a word.\nTo do this, we first record a &quot;background&quot; sound level, that is the value produced by the sensor when we're not talking at all.\nfloat backgroundSound = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    pinMode(MIC, INPUT);\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++)\n        backgroundSound += readMic();\n\n    backgroundSound /= 200;\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Background sound level is &quot;);\n    Serial.println(backgroundSound);\n}\nAt this point we can check for the starting of a word when the detected sound level exceeds tha background one by a given threshold.\n// adjust as per your need\n// it will depend on the sensitivity of you microphone\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 3\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool soundDetected() {\n    return abs(read() - backgroundSound) &gt;= SOUND_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.3 Record the words\nAs for the gestures, we'll record a fixed number of readings at a fixed interval.\nHere a tradeoff arises: you want to have a decent number of readings to be able to accurately describe the words you want to classify, but not too much otherwise your model is going to be too large to fit in your board.\nI made some experiments, and I got good results with 32 samples at 5 millis interval, which covers ~150 ms of speech.\n\nThe dilemma here is that the Fourier Transform to work needs a number of samples that is a power of 2. So, if you think 32 features are not enough for you, you're forced to go with at least 64: this has a REALLY bad impact on the model size.\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 32\n#define INTERVAL 5\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n}\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n2.4 Fast Fourier Transform\nHere we are with the Fourier Transform. When implemented in software, the most widely implementation of the FT is actually called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is - as you may guess - a fast implementation of the FT. \nLuckily for us, there exists a library for Arduino that does FFT.\nAnd is so easy to use that we only need a line to get usable results!\n#include &lt;arduinoFFT.h&gt;\n\narduinoFFT fft;\n\nvoid captureWord() {\n    for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        features[i] = readMic();\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    fft.Windowing(features, NUM_SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);\n}\nYou don't need to know what the Windowing function actually does (I don't either): what matters is that it extracts meaningful informations from our signal. Since it overwrites the features array, after calling that line we have what we need to input to our classifier.\nAt this point, record 10-15 samples for each word and save them to a file, one for each word.\n\nAfter you have recorded the samples for a word, I suggest you to manually check them. It is sufficient to look at the first 3 values: if one of them seems to be clearly out of range, I suggest you to delete it. You will lose some accuracy, but your model will be smaller.\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily.\nAudio is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\nSelect a suitable model\nHere's an overview table of the 3 tests I did.\n\n\n\nKernel\nNo. support vectors\nAvg. accuracy\n\n\n\n\nLinear\n22\n87%\n\n\nPoly 3\n29\n91%\n\n\nRBF\n36\n94%\n\n\n\nOf course the one with the RBF kernel would be the most desiderable since it has a very high accuracy: 36 support vectors, tough, will produce a model too large to fit on an Arduino Nano.\nSo you're forced to pick the one with the highest accuracy that fit on your board: in my case it was the Linear kernel one.\n3. Run the inference\n#include &quot;model.h&quot;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (!soundDetected()) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    captureWord();\n    Serial.print(&quot;You said &quot;);\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n\n    delay(1000);\n}\nAnd that's it: word classification through machine learning on your Arduino board! Say some word and see the classification result on the Serial monitor. \nHere's me testing the system (English is not my language, so forgive my bad pronounce). The video quality is very low, I know, but you get the point.\n\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Word-classification.mp4\n\nAs you can hear from the video, you should be quite accurate when pronouncing the words. I have to admit there are cases where the system totally fails to classify correctly the words. Restarting helps most of the time, so I'm suspecting there could be some kind of leak that \"corrupts\" the inference procedure.\n\nDid you find this tutorial useful?

Each feature will be the RSSI of the given SSID, in the exact order we populated the knownNetworks array.\nIn practice:\nfeatures[0] == RSSI of &quot;Put your SSID #0&quot;;\nfeatures[1] == RSSI of &quot;Put your SSID #1&quot;;\nfeatures[2] == RSSI of &quot;Put your SSID #2&quot;;\nfeatures[3] == RSSI of &quot;Put your SSID #3&quot;;\n// and so on\nThe code below will do the job.\nvoid loop() {\n    scan();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid scan() {\n    int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n    resetFeatures();\n\n    // assign RSSIs to feature vector\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n        String ssid = WiFi.SSID(i);\n        uint16_t networkIndex = knownNetworks.indexOf(ssid);\n\n        // only create feature if the current SSID is a known one\n        if (!isnan(networkIndex))\n            features[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n    }\n}\n\n// reset all features to 0\nvoid resetFeatures() {\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatues; i++)\n        features[i] = 0;\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nGrab some recordings just staying in a location for a few seconds and save the serial output to a file; then move to the next location and repeat: 10-15 samples for each location will suffice.\nIf you do a good job, you should end with distinguible features, as show in the plot below.\n\n\nRSSIs may be a little noisy, mostly on the boundaries where weak networks may appear and disappear with a very low RSSI: this was not a problem for me, but if you're getting bad results you may filter out those low values.\n\n// replace\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n\n// with\n#define MIN_RSSI -90 // adjust to your needs\n\nfeatures[networkIndex] = WiFi.RSSI(i) > MIN_RSSI ? WiFi.RSSI(i) : 0;\n\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\n4. Run the inference\n#include &quot;model.h&quot;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    scan();\n    classify();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid classify() {\n    Serial.print(&quot;You are in &quot;);\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n}\nMove around your house/office/whatever and see your location printed on the serial monitor!\nDid you find this tutorial useful?

Features definition</h2>\n<p>We're going to use the accelerations along the 3 axis (X, Y, Z) coming from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit\">IMU</a> to infer which gesture we're playing. We'll use a fixed number of recordings (<code>NUM_SAMPLES</code>) starting from the first detection of movement. </p>\n<p>This means our feature vectors are going to be of dimension <code>3 * NUM_SAMPLES</code>, which can become too large to fit in the memory of the Arduino Nano. We'll start with a low value for <code>NUM_SAMPLES</code> to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.</p>\n<h3>2.

Here comes the culprit: not all models will fit on your board.</p>\n<p>The core of SVM (Support Vector Machines) are support vectors: each trained classifier will be characterized by a certain number of them. The problem is: if there're too much, the generated code will be too large to fit in your flash.</p>\n<p>For this reason, instead of selecting <em>the best</em> model on accuracy, you should make a ranking, from the best performing to the worst. For each model, starting from the top, you should import it in your Arduino project and try to compile: if it fits, fine, you're done.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use an accelerometer sensor to identify the gestures you play.\nThis is a remake of the project found on the Tensorflow blog. We're going to use a lot less powerful chip in this tutorial, tough: an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nThis tutorial is part of a series of tutorials about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:\r\n\r\n  define the features\r\n  record sample data: repeat each gesture a few times and save the values from the serial monitor to a file, one for each gesture\r\n train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using micromlgen\r\n copy and paste the generated code in a model.h file in the Arduino project and call predict() from it\r\n\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the accelerations along the 3 axis (X, Y, Z) coming from an IMU to infer which gesture we're playing. We'll use a fixed number of recordings (NUM_SAMPLES) starting from the first detection of movement. \nThis means our feature vectors are going to be of dimension 3 * NUM_SAMPLES, which can become too large to fit in the memory of the Arduino Nano. We'll start with a low value for NUM_SAMPLES to keep it as leaner as possible: if your classifications suffer from poor accuracy, you can increase this number.\n2. Record sample data\n2.1 Read the IMU sensor\nFirst of all, we need to read the raw data from the IMU. This piece of code will be different based on the specific chip you use. To keep things consistent, we'll wrap the IMU logic in 2 functions: imu_setup and imu_read. \nI'll report a couple of example implementations for the MPU6050 and the MPU9250 (these are the chip I have at hand). You should save whichever code you use in a file called imu.h. \n#include &quot;Wire.h&quot;\n// library from https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050\n#include &quot;MPU6050.h&quot;\n#define OUTPUT_READABLE_ACCELGYRO\n\nMPU6050 imu;\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.initialize();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    float gx, gy, gz;\n\n    imu.getMotion6(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az, &amp;gx, &amp;gy, &amp;gz);\n}\n#include &quot;Wire.h&quot;\n// library from https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250\n#include &quot;MPU9250.h&quot;\n\nMPU9250 imu(Wire, 0x68);\n\nvoid imu_setup() {\n    Wire.begin();\n    imu.begin();\n}\n\nvoid imu_read(float *ax, float *ay, float *az) {\n    imu.readSensor();\n\n    *ax = imu.getAccelX_mss();\n    *ay = imu.getAccelY_mss();\n    *az = imu.getAccelZ_mss();\n}\nIn the main .ino file, we dump the values to Serial monitor / plotter.\n#include &quot;imu.h&quot;\n\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 30\n#define NUM_AXES 3\n// sometimes you may get &quot;spikes&quot; in the readings\n// set a sensible value to truncate too large values\n#define TRUNCATE_AT 20\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    ay = constrain(ay, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n    az = constrain(az, -TRUNCATE_AT, TRUNCATE_AT);\n\n    Serial.print(ax);\n    Serial.print(&#039;\\t&#039;);\n    Serial.print(ay);\n    Serial.print(&#039;\\t&#039;);\n    Serial.println(az);\n}\nOpen the Serial plotter and make some movement to have an idea of the range of your readings.\n\n2.2 Calibration\nDon't know if it's just my case, but I'm getting az values of about -10 at rest (you can see this in the previous image). Since I'd like to have almost 0 at rest, I created a super simple calibration procedure to remove this fixed offset from the readings.\nIf you're already getting all zeros, you can skip this part. Still, if you add it to your project it won't hurt.\ndouble baseline[NUM_AXES];\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES * NUM_AXES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    imu_setup();\n    calibrate();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n}\n\nvoid calibrate() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n        delay(100);\n    }\n\n    baseline[0] = ax;\n    baseline[1] = ay;\n    baseline[2] = az;\n}\n\nMuch better.\n2.3 Detect first motion\nNow we need to check if motion is happening. To keep it simple, we'll use a naive approach that will look for an high value in the acceleration: if a threshold is exceeded, a gesture is starting. \nIf you did the calibration step, a threshold of 5 should work well. If you didn't calibrate, you have to come up with a value that suits your needs.\n#include imu.h\n\n#define ACCEL_THRESHOLD 5\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nbool motionDetected(float ax, float ay, float az) {\n    return (abs(ax) + abs(ay) + abs(az)) &gt; ACCEL_THRESHOLD;\n}\n2.4 Record features\nIf no motion is happening, we don't take any action and keep watching. If motion is happening, we print the next NUM_SAMPLES readings to Serial. \nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    recordIMU();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(2000);\n}\n\nvoid recordIMU() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n        imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n        ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n        az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 0] = ax;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 1] = ay;\n        features[i * NUM_AXES + 2] = az;\n\n        delay(INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nRecord 15-20 samples for each geasture and save them to a file, one for each gesture. Since we're dealing with highly dimensional data, you should collect as much samples as possible, to average out the noise.\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\nIn this project on Machine learning, differently from the previous and simpler ones, we're not achieving 100% accuracy easily. Motion is quite noise, so you should experiment with a few params for the classifier and choose the ones that perform best. I'll showcase a few examples:\n\n\n\n\nSelect a suitable model\nNow that we selected the best model, we have to export it to C code. Here comes the culprit: not all models will fit on your board.\nThe core of SVM (Support Vector Machines) are support vectors: each trained classifier will be characterized by a certain number of them. The problem is: if there're too much, the generated code will be too large to fit in your flash.\nFor this reason, instead of selecting the best model on accuracy, you should make a ranking, from the best performing to the worst. For each model, starting from the top, you should import it in your Arduino project and try to compile: if it fits, fine, you're done. Otherwise you should pick the next and try again.\nIt may seem a tedious process, but keep in mind that we're trying to infer a class from 90 features in 2 Kb of RAM and 32 Kb of flash: I think this is an acceptable tradeoff.\nWe&#039;re fitting a model to infer a class from 90 features in 2 Kb of RAM and 32 Kb of flash!Click To Tweet\nI'll report a few figures for different combinations I tested.\n\n\n\nKernel\nC\nGamma\nDegree\nVectors\nFlash size\nRAM (b)\nAvg accuracy\n\n\n\n\nRBF\n10\n0.001\n-\n37\n53 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n2\n12\n25 Kb\n1228\n99%\n\n\nPoly\n100\n0.001\n3\n25\n40 Kb\n1228\n97%\n\n\nLinear\n50\n-\n1\n40\n55 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\nRBF\n100\n0.01\n-\n61\n80 Kb\n1228\n95%\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we achieved a very high accuracy on the test set for all the classifiers: only one, though, fitted on the Arduino Nano. Of course, if you use a larger board, you can deploy the others too.\nAs a side note, take a look at the RAM column: all the values are equal: this is because in the implementation is independant from the number of support vectors and only depends on the number of features.\n3. Run the inference\n#include &quot;model.h&quot;\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float ax, ay, az;\n\n    imu_read(&amp;ax, &amp;ay, &amp;az);\n\n    ax = constrain(ax - baseline[0], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    ay = constrain(ay - baseline[1], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n    az = constrain(az - baseline[2], -TRUNCATE, TRUNCATE);\n\n    if (!motionDetected(ax, ay, az)) {\n        delay(10);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    recordIMU();\n    classify();\n    delay(2000);\n}\n\nvoid classify() {\n    Serial.print(&quot;Detected gesture: &quot;);\n    Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n}\nHere we are: it has been a long post, but now you can classify gestures with an Arduino Nano and 2 Kb of RAM. \nNo fancy Neural Networks, no Tensorflow, no 32-bit ARM processors: plain old SVM on plain old 8 bits with 97% accuracy.Click To Tweet\nHere's a short demo of me playing 3 gestures and getting the results on the serial monitor.\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gesture-identification-in-action.mp4\nProject figures\r\nOn my machine, the sketch targeted at the Arduino Nano (old generation) requires 25310 bytes (82%) of program space and 1228 bytes (59%) of RAM.

            "content_html": "<p>In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to identify the letters from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code\">Morse alphabet</a>.<br />\nIn practice, we'll translate dots (\u2022) and dashes (\u2012)  &quot;typed&quot; with a push button into meaningful characters.<br />\nIn this tutorial we're going to target an Arduino Nano board (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-194\"></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L6gxfX4GrbI/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6gxfX4GrbI\" /></p>\n<p>This tutorial is part of a <a href=\"/category/programming/arduino-machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">series of tutorials</a> about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>define the features</li>\r\n  <li>record sample data: repeat each letter a few times and save the values from the serial monitor to a file, one for each letter.</li>\r\n <li>train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using <code><a href=\"https://github.com/agrimagsrl/micromlgen\" target=\"_blank\">micromlgen</a></code></li>\r\n <li>copy and paste the generated code in a <code>model.h</code> file in the Arduino project and call <code>predict()</code> from it</li>\r\n</ol>\n<h3>1. Features definition</h3>\n<p>For our task we'll use a simple push button as input and a fixed number of samples taken at a fixed interval (100 ms), starting from the first detection of the button press. I chose to record 30 samples for each letter, but you can easily customize the value as per your needs. </p>\n<p>With 30 samples at 100 ms frequency, we'll have 3 seconds to &quot;type&quot; the letter and on the Serial monitor will appear a sequence of 0s and 1s, representing if the button was pressed or not; the inference procedure will translate this sequence into a letter.<br />\nAs a reference, here are a couple example of what we'll be working with.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">// A (\u2022\u2012)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// D (\u2012\u2022\u2022)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// E (\u2022)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1</code></pre>\n<h3>2. Record sample data</h3>\n<p>To the bare minimum, we'll need a push button and two wires: one to ground and the other to a digital pin.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to identify the letters from the Morse alphabet.\nIn practice, we'll translate dots (\u2022) and dashes (\u2012)  &quot;typed&quot; with a push button into meaningful characters.\nIn this tutorial we're going to target an Arduino Nano board (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\n\nThis tutorial is part of a series of tutorials about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:\r\n\r\n  define the features\r\n  record sample data: repeat each letter a few times and save the values from the serial monitor to a file, one for each letter.\r\n train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using micromlgen\r\n copy and paste the generated code in a model.h file in the Arduino project and call predict() from it\r\n\n1. Features definition\nFor our task we'll use a simple push button as input and a fixed number of samples taken at a fixed interval (100 ms), starting from the first detection of the button press. I chose to record 30 samples for each letter, but you can easily customize the value as per your needs. \nWith 30 samples at 100 ms frequency, we'll have 3 seconds to &quot;type&quot; the letter and on the Serial monitor will appear a sequence of 0s and 1s, representing if the button was pressed or not; the inference procedure will translate this sequence into a letter.\nAs a reference, here are a couple example of what we'll be working with.\n// A (\u2022\u2012)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// D (\u2012\u2022\u2022)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// E (\u2022)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n2. Record sample data\nTo the bare minimum, we'll need a push button and two wires: one to ground and the other to a digital pin. Since in the example we'll make the button an INPUT_PULLUP, we'll read 0 when the button is pressed and 1 when not.  \n\nAll we need to do is detect a press and record the following 30 samples of the digital pin:\n#define IN 4\n#define NUM_SAMPLES 30\n#define INTERVAL 100\n\ndouble features[NUM_SAMPLES];\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  pinMode(IN, INPUT_PULLUP);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (digitalRead(IN) == 0) {\n    recordButtonStatus();\n    printFeatures();\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  delay(10);\n}\n\nvoid recordButtonStatus() {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_SAMPLES; i++) {\n    features[i] = digitalRead(IN);\n    delay(INTERVAL);\n  } \n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nOpen the Serial monitor and type a few times each letter: try to introduce some variations each time, for example waiting some more milliseconds before releasing the dash.\n If you've never typed morse code before (as me), choose letters with few keystrokes and quite differentiable, otherwise you will need to be very good with the timing.\nSave the recordings for each letter in a file named after the letter, so you will get meaningful results later on.\nYou may end with duplicate recordings: don't worry, that's not a problem. I'll paste my recordings for a few letters, as a reference.\n// A (\u2022\u2012)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// D (\u2012\u2022\u2022)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// E (\u2022)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// S (\u2022\u2022\u2022)\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\n// T (\u2012)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\nIf you do a good job, you should end with quite distinguible features, as show in the plot below.\n\n3.

            "content_text": "In this Arduno Machine learning project we're going to use an RGB sensor to identify objects based on their color.\nThis is a remake of the project found on the Tensorflow blog. We're going to use a lot less powerful chip in this tutorial, tough: an Arduino Nano (old generation), equipped with 32 kb of flash and only 2 kb of RAM.\n\nThis tutorial is part of a series of tutorials about Machine learning on Arduino and all follow the same outline:\r\n\r\n  define the features\r\n  record sample data: put some colored objects in front of your sensor and save the readings\r\n train an SVM classifier with Python's scikit-learn and export it to optimized C code using micromlgen\r\n copy and paste the generated code in a model.h file in the Arduino project and call predict() from it\r\n\n1. Features definition\nWe're going to use the RGB components of a color sensor (TCS3200 in my case) to infer which object we're pointing it at. This means our features are going to be of 3-dimensional, which leads to a really simple model with very high accuracy.\nYou can do color identification on Arduino using Machine learning without Neural Networks #Arduino #microml #ml #tinyml #MachineLearning #ai #svmClick To Tweet\n2. Record sample data\nWe don't need any processing to get from the sensor readings to the feature vector, so the code will be straight-forward: read each component from the sensor and assign it to the features array. This part will vary based on the specific chip you have: I'll report the code for a TCS 230/3200. \n#define S2 2\n#define S3 3\n#define sensorOut 4\n\ndouble features[3];\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  pinMode(S2, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(S3, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(sensorOut, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  readRGB();\n  printFeatures();\n  delay(100);\n}\n\nint readComponent(bool s2, bool s3) {\n  delay(10);\n  digitalWrite(S2, s2);\n  digitalWrite(S3, s3);\n\n  return pulseIn(sensorOut, LOW);\n}\n\nvoid readRGB() {\n  features[0] = readComponent(LOW, LOW);\n  features[1] = readComponent(HIGH, HIGH);\n  features[2] = readComponent(LOW, HIGH);\n}\n\r\nvoid printFeatures() {\r\n    const uint16_t numFeatures = sizeof(features) / sizeof(double);\r\n    \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numFeatures; i++) {\r\n        Serial.print(features[i]);\r\n        Serial.print(i == numFeatures - 1 ? '\\n' : ',');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\nOpen the Serial monitor and put some colored objects in front of the sensor: move the object a bit and rotate it, so the samples will include different shades of the color.\nSave the recordings for each color in a file named after the color, so you will get meaningful results later on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to sample the \u201cempty color\u201d too: don\u2019t put anything in front of the sensor and let it record for a while.\n\nIf you do a good job, you should end with distinguible features, as show in the contour plot below.\n\n3. Train and export the SVM classifier\r\n\r\nFor a detailed guide refer to the tutorial\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom micromlgen import port\r\n\r\n# put your samples in the dataset folder\r\n# one class per file\r\n# one feature vector per line, in CSV format\r\nfeatures, classmap = load_features('dataset/')\r\nX, y = features[:, :-1], features[:, -1]\r\nclassifier = SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)\r\nc_code = port(classifier, classmap=classmap)\r\nprint(c_code)\r\n\r\nAt this point you have to copy the printed code and import it in your Arduino project, in a file called model.h.\n4. Run the inference\n#include model.h\n\nvoid loop() {\n  readRGB();\n  Serial.println(classIdxToName(predict(features)));\n  delay(1000);\n}\nPut some colored object in front of the sensor and see the identified object name printed on the serial monitor.\nDo you remember the \"empty color\"? It needs to be recorded so you will get \"empty\" when no object is present, otherwise you'll get unexpected predictions\nGiven the simplicity of the task, you should easily achieve near 100% accuracy for different colors (I had some troubles distinguishing orange from yellow because of the bad illumination). Just be sure to replicate the exact same setup both during training and classification.\nThat\u2019s it: you deployed machine learning in 2 Kb! \nProject figures\r\nOn my machine, the sketch targeted at the Arduino Nano (old generation) requires 5570 bytes (18%) of program space and 266 bytes (12%) of RAM. This means you could actually run machine learning in even less space than what the Arduino Nano provides. So, the answer to the question Can I run machine learning on Arduino? is definetly YES.\nDid you find this tutorial useful? Was is it easy to follow or did I miss something? Let me know in the comments so I can keep improving the blog.\n\r\nCheck the full project code on Github\nL'articolo How to do color identification through machine learning on Arduino proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",
