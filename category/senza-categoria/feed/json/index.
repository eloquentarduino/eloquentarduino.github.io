As I said, I have a M5Stick Camera with fish-eye lens, but any ESP32 based camera should work out of the box:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ESP32 cam</li>\n<li>ESP32 eye</li>\n<li>TTGO camera</li>\n<li>... any other flavor of ESP32 camera</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ESP32-camera-models.jpg\" alt=\"ESP32 camera models\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tochow-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Ok, let's go to the &quot;technical&quot; stuff.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the algorithm counts the number of different pixels from one frame to the next: if many pixels changed, it will detect motion.</p>\n<p>Well, it's <em>almost</em> like this.</p>\n<p>Of course such an algorithm will be very sensitive to noise (which is quite high on these low-cost cameras). We need to mitigate false-positive triggers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocdownsampling\">Downsampling</h3>\n<p>One super-simple and super-effective way of doing this is to <strong>work with blocks</strong>, instead of pixels. A block is simply an N x N square, whose value is the average of the pixels it contains.</p>\n<p>This greatly reduces sensitivity to noise, providing a more robust detection. Here's an example of what the the &quot;block-ing&quot; operation does to an image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Image-downsampling-example.jpg\" alt=\"Image downsampling example\" /></p>\n<p>It's really a &quot;pixelating&quot; effect: you take the orginal image (let's say 320x240 pixels) and resize it to 10x smaller, 32x24.  </p>\n<p>This has the added benefit that it's much more lightweight to work with 32x24 matrix instead of 320x240 matrix: if you want to do real-time detection, this is a MUST.</p>\n<p>How should you choose the scale factor?</p>\n<p>Well, it depends.</p>\n<p>It depends on the sensitivity you want to achieve. The higher the downsampling, the less sensitive your detection will be. </p>\n<p>If you want to detect a person passing 50cm away from the camera, you can increase this number without any problem. If you want to detect a dog 10m away, you should keep it in the 5-10 range.</p>\n<p>Experiment with your own use case a tweak with trial-and-error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocblocks-difference-threshold\">Blocks difference threshold</h3>\n<p>Once we've defined the block size, we need to detect if a block changed from one frame to the next.</p>\n<p>Of course, just testing for difference (<code>current != prev</code>) would be again too sensitive to noise. A block can change for a variety of reasons, the first of which is the bad camera quality.</p>\n<p>So we instead define a percent threshold above which we can say for sure the block actually changed. A good starting point could be 10-20%, but again you need to tweak this to your needs.</p>\n<p>The higher the threshold, the less sensitive the algorithm will be.</p>\n<p>In code it is calculated as</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">float delta = abs(currentBlockValue - prevBlockValue) / prevBlockValue;</code></pre>\n<p>which indicates the relative increment/decrement from the previous value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocimage-difference-threshold\">Image difference threshold</h3>\n<p>Now that we can detect if a block changed from one frame to the next, we can actually detect if the image changed.</p>\n<p>You could decide to trigger motion even if a single block changed, but I suggest you to set an higher value here.</p>\n<p>Let's return to the 320x240 image example. With a 10x10 block, you'll be working with <code>32x24 = 768</code> blocks: will you call it &quot;motion&quot; if 1 out of 768 blocks changed value?</p>\n<p>I don't think so. You want something more robust. You want 50 blocks to change. Or at least 20 blocks. If you do the math, 20 blocks out of 768 is only the 2.5% of change, which is hardly noticeable.</p>\n<p>If you want to be robust, don't set this threshold to a too low value. Again, tweak with real world experimenting.</p>\n<p>In code it is calculated as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">float changedBlocksPercent = changedBlocks / totalBlocks</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"toccombining-all-together\">Combining all together</h3>\n<p>Recapping: when running the motion detection algorithm you have 3 parameters to set:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the block size</li>\n<li>the block difference threshold</li>\n<li>the image differerence threshold</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's pick 3 sensible defaults: <code>block size = 10</code>, <code>block threshold = 15%</code>, <code>image threshold = 20%</code>.</p>\n<p>What does these parameters translate to in the practice?</p>\n<p>They mean that motion will be detected if <code>20% of the image, averaged in blocks of 10x10, changed its value by at least 15% from one frame to the next</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ESP32-camera-motion-example.jpg\" alt=\"ESP32 camera motion example\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, you don't need high-definition images to (naively) detect if something happened to the image.
