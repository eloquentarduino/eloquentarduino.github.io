I used an <em>image-like</em> dataset to create a setup where CNN should perform well: the dataset is the <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\">MNIST handwritten digits</a> one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*LyRlX__08q40UJohhJG9Ow.png\" alt=\"MNIST dataset example\" /></p>\n<p>It is composed by <strong>8x8</strong> images of handwritten digits, from 0 to 9 and can be easily imported via the <code>scikit-learn</code> Python package.</p>\n<p>Regarding the CNN topology, I wanted to stay as lean as possible: the goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to deploy your own network, not about achieving 100% accuracy.</p>\n<p>Let's see step by step how to produce a usable model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocstep-1-import-the-libraries\">Step 1. Import the libraries</h3>\n<p>We will need <code>numpy</code> and <code>Tensorflow</code>, of course, plus <code>scikit-learn</code> to load the dataset and <a href=\"https://github.com/eloquentarduino/tinymlgen\">tinymlgen</a> to port the CNN to plain C.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom tinymlgen import port</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocstep-2-generate-train-validation-and-test-data\">Step 2. Generate train, validation and test data</h3>\n<p>To train the network, we need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>training data</code>: this is the data the network uses to learn its weights</li>\n<li><code>validation data</code>: this is the data the network uses to understand if it's doing well during learning</li>\n<li><code>test data</code>: this is the data we use to test the network accuracy once it's done learning</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def get_data():\n    np.random.seed(1337)\n    x_values, y_values = load_digits(return_X_y=True)\n    x_values /= x_values.max()\n    # reshape to (8 x 8 x 1)\n    x_values = x_values.reshape((len(x_values), 8, 8, 1))\n\n    # split into train, validation, test\n    TRAIN_SPLIT = int(0.6 * len(x_values))\n    TEST_SPLIT = int(0.2 * len(x_values) + TRAIN_SPLIT)\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate = np.split(x_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n    y_train, y_test, y_validate = np.split(y_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n\n    return x_train, x_test, x_validate, y_train, y_test, y_validate</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocstep-3-create-and-train-the-model\">Step 3. Create and train the model</h3>\n<p>Now we have to create our network topology.</p>\n<p>As I stated earlier, I wanted to keep this as simple as possible (also considering that we're using a toy dataset): I added a single convolution layer (without even max pooling) followed by the output layer.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def get_model():\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate, y_train, y_test, y_validate = get_data()\n\n    # create a CNN\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation=&#039;relu&#039;, input_shape=(8, 8, 1)))\n    # model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))\n    model.add(layers.Flatten())\n    model.add(layers.Dense(len(np.unique(y_train))))\n\n    model.compile(optimizer=&#039;adam&#039;, loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=[&#039;accuracy&#039;])\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=16,\n                        validation_data=(x_validate, y_validate))\n    return model, x_test, y_test</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tocstep-4-testing-the-model-accuracy\">Step 4.

            "content_text": "Painless TinyML Convolutional Neural Network on your Arduino and STM32 boards: the MNIST dataset example!\nAre you fascinated by TinyML and Tensorflow for microcontrollers? \nDo you want to run a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on your Arduino and STM32 boards? \nDo you want to do it without pain? \nEloquentTinyML is the library for you!\n\n\nEloquentTinyML, my library to easily run Tensorflow Lite neural networks on Arduino microcontrollers, is gaining some popularity so I think it's time for a good tutorial on the topic.\nIf you're a seasoned follower of my blog, you may know that I don't really like Tensorflow on microcontrollers, because it is often &quot;over-sized&quot; for the project at hand and there are leaner, faster alternatives.\nNonetheless, Tensorflow is gaining much popularity in the embedded world so I'll try to give my contribute too.\nIn this tutorial, I'm going to show you step by step how to train a CNN in Tensorflow and deploy it to you board: I tested the code both on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and the STM32 Nucleus L432KC.\nTable of contentsHow to train a CNN in TensorflowStep 1. Import the librariesStep 2. Generate train, validation and test dataStep 3. Create and train the modelStep 4. Testing the model accuracyStep 5. Exporting the modelHow to run a CNN on Arduino and STM32 boards with EloquentTinyMLCNN on Arduino and STM32 figuresAnd you?\nHow to train a CNN in Tensorflow\nI'm not an expert either in Tensorflow nor Convolutional Neural Networks, so I kept the project as simple as possible. I used an image-like dataset to create a setup where CNN should perform well: the dataset is the MNIST handwritten digits one.\n\nIt is composed by 8x8 images of handwritten digits, from 0 to 9 and can be easily imported via the scikit-learn Python package.\nRegarding the CNN topology, I wanted to stay as lean as possible: the goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to deploy your own network, not about achieving 100% accuracy.\nLet's see step by step how to produce a usable model.\nStep 1. Import the libraries\nWe will need numpy and Tensorflow, of course, plus scikit-learn to load the dataset and tinymlgen to port the CNN to plain C.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom tinymlgen import port\nStep 2. Generate train, validation and test data\nTo train the network, we need:\n\ntraining data: this is the data the network uses to learn its weights\nvalidation data: this is the data the network uses to understand if it's doing well during learning\ntest data: this is the data we use to test the network accuracy once it's done learning\n\ndef get_data():\n    np.random.seed(1337)\n    x_values, y_values = load_digits(return_X_y=True)\n    x_values /= x_values.max()\n    # reshape to (8 x 8 x 1)\n    x_values = x_values.reshape((len(x_values), 8, 8, 1))\n\n    # split into train, validation, test\n    TRAIN_SPLIT = int(0.6 * len(x_values))\n    TEST_SPLIT = int(0.2 * len(x_values) + TRAIN_SPLIT)\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate = np.split(x_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n    y_train, y_test, y_validate = np.split(y_values, [TRAIN_SPLIT, TEST_SPLIT])\n\n    return x_train, x_test, x_validate, y_train, y_test, y_validate\nStep 3. Create and train the model\nNow we have to create our network topology.\nAs I stated earlier, I wanted to keep this as simple as possible (also considering that we're using a toy dataset): I added a single convolution layer (without even max pooling) followed by the output layer.\ndef get_model():\n    x_train, x_test, x_validate, y_train, y_test, y_validate = get_data()\n\n    # create a CNN\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation=&#039;relu&#039;, input_shape=(8, 8, 1)))\n    # model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))\n    model.add(layers.Flatten())\n    model.add(layers.Dense(len(np.unique(y_train))))\n\n    model.compile(optimizer=&#039;adam&#039;, loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=[&#039;accuracy&#039;])\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=16,\n                        validation_data=(x_validate, y_validate))\n    return model, x_test, y_test\nStep 4. Testing the model accuracy\nDo you think this topology is too simple to learn something useful in so few epochs?\nThink again: it achieved 97% accuracy!\nNot bad.\ndef test_model(model, x_test, y_test):\n    x_test = (x_test / x_test.max()).reshape((len(x_test), 8, 8, 1))\n    y_pred = model.predict(x_test).argmax(axis=1)\n\n    print(&#039;ACCURACY&#039;, (y_pred == y_test).sum() / len(y_test))\nStep 5. Exporting the model\nOnce we have a trained model that performs well, we want to deploy it to our microcontroller.

It is so simple to understand that it was probably the first classifier you encountered in any Machine Learning course.</p>\n<p>I won't go into the details of how a Decision Tree classifier trains and selects the splits for the input features: here I will explain how a RAM-efficient porting of such a classifier is implemented.</p>\n<p>To an introduction visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning\">Wikipedia</a>; for a more in-depth guide visit <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/decision-tree-algorithm-explained.html\">KDNuggets</a>.</p>\n<p>Since we're willing to sacrifice program space (a.k.a flash) in favor of memory (a.k.a RAM), because RAM is the most scarce resource in the vast majority of microcontrollers, the smart way to port a Decision Tree classifier from Python to C is &quot;hard-coding&quot; the splits in code, without keeping any reference to them into variables.</p>\n<p>Here's what it looks like for a Decision tree that classifies the Iris dataset.</p>\n<p>As you can see, we're using <strong>0 bytes of RAM</strong> to get the classification result, since no variable is being allocated. On the other side, the program space will grow almost linearly with the number of splits.</p>\n<p>Since program space is often much greater than RAM on microcontrollers, this implementation exploits its abundance to be able to deploy larger models. How much large?

It is so simple to understand that it was probably the first classifier you encountered in any Machine Learning course.\nI won't go into the details of how a Decision Tree classifier trains and selects the splits for the input features: here I will explain how a RAM-efficient porting of such a classifier is implemented.\nTo an introduction visit Wikipedia; for a more in-depth guide visit KDNuggets.\nSince we're willing to sacrifice program space (a.k.a flash) in favor of memory (a.k.a RAM), because RAM is the most scarce resource in the vast majority of microcontrollers, the smart way to port a Decision Tree classifier from Python to C is &quot;hard-coding&quot; the splits in code, without keeping any reference to them into variables.\nHere's what it looks like for a Decision tree that classifies the Iris dataset.\nAs you can see, we're using 0 bytes of RAM to get the classification result, since no variable is being allocated. On the other side, the program space will grow almost linearly with the number of splits.\nSince program space is often much greater than RAM on microcontrollers, this implementation exploits its abundance to be able to deploy larger models. How much large? It will depend on the flash size available: many new generations board (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, ST Nucleus...) have 1 Mb of flash, which will hold tens of thousands of splits. \nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest is just many Decision Trees joined together in a voting scheme. The core idea is that of &quot;the wisdom of the corwd&quot;, such that if many trees vote for a given class (having being trained on different subsets of the training set), that class is probably the true class.\nTowards Data Science has a more detailed guide on Random Forest and how it balances the trees with thebagging tecnique.\nAs easy as Decision Trees, Random Forest gets the exact same implementation with 0 bytes of RAM required (it actually needs as many bytes as the number of classes to store the votes, but that's really negligible): it just hard-codes all its composing trees.\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\nExtreme Gradient Boosting is &quot;Gradient Boosting on steroids&quot; and has gained much attention from the Machine learning community due to its top results in many data competitions.\n\n&quot;gradient boosting&quot; refers to the process of chaining a number of trees so that each tree tries to learn from the errors of the previous\n&quot;extreme&quot; refers to many software and hardware optimizations that greatly reduce the time it takes to train the model\n\nYou can read the original paper about XGBoost here. For a discursive description head to KDNuggets, if you want some more math refer to this blog post on Medium.\nPorting to plain C\nIf you followed my earlier posts on Gaussian Naive Bayes, SEFR, Relevant Vector Machine and Support Vector Machines, you already know how to port these new classifiers.\nIf you're new, you will need a couple things:\n\ninstall the micromlgen package with \n\npip install micromlgen\n\n(optionally, if you want to use Extreme Gradient Boosting) install the xgboost package with \n\npip install xgboost\n\nuse the micromlgen.port function to generate your plain C code\n\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nclf.fit(X, y)\nprint(port(clf))\nYou can then copy-past the C code and import it in your sketch.\nUsing in the Arduino sketch\nOnce you have the classifier code, create a new project named TreeClassifierExample and copy the classifier code into a file named DecisionTree.h (or RandomForest.h or XGBoost.h depending on the model you chose).\nThe copy the following to the main ino file.\n#include &quot;DecisionTree.h&quot;\n\nEloquent::ML::Port::DecisionTree clf;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    Serial.println(&quot;Begin&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    float irisSample[4] = {6.2, 2.8, 4.8, 1.8};\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Predicted label (you should see &#039;2&#039;: &quot;);\n    Serial.println(clf.predict(irisSample));\n    delay(1000);\n}\nBechmarks\nHow do the 3 classifiers compare against each other?\nWe will evaluate a few keypoints:\n\ntraining time\naccuracy\nneeded RAM\nneeded Flash\n\nfor each classifier on a variety of datasets.

            "content_text": "Fourier Transform is probably the most well known algorithm for feature extraction from time-dependent data (in particular speech data), where frequency holds a great deal of information. Sadly, computing the transform over the whole spectrum of the signal still requires O(NlogN) with the best implementation (FFT - Fast Fourier Transform); we would like to achieve faster computation on our microcontrollers.\nIn this post I propose a partial, naive linear-time implementation of the Fourier Transform you can use to extract features from your data for Machine Learning models.\n\n\nTable of contentsTraining-aware FFTAccuracy comparisonHow to use Principal FFT in PythonHow to use Principal FFT in CBenchmarking\nDISCLAIMER\nThe contents of this post represent my own knowledge and are not supported by any academic work (as far as I know). It may really be the case that the findings of my work don't apply to your own projects; yet, I think this idea can turn useful in solving certain kind of problems.\nTraining-aware FFT\nFourier transform is used to describe a signal over its entire frequency range. This is useful in a number of applications, but here we're focused on the FT for the sole purpose of extracting features to be used with Machine learning models.\nFor this reason, we don't actually need a full description of the input signal: we're only interested in extracting some kind of signature that a ML model can use to distinguish among the different classes. Noticing that in a signal spectrum most frequencies have a low magnitude (as you can see in the picture above), the idea to only keep the most important frequencies came to my mind as a mean to speed up the computation on resource constrained microcontrollers.\nI was thinking to a kind of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), but using FFT spectrum as features.\nSince we will have a training set with the raw signals, we would like to select the most prominent frequencies among all the samples and apply the computation only on those: even using the naive implementation of FFT, this will yield a linear-time implementation.\nAccuracy comparison\nHow does this Principal FFT compare to, let's say, PCA as a dimensionality reduction algorithm w.r.t model accuracy? Let's see the numbers!\n\nDownload the Principal FFT benchmark spreadsheet\nI couldn't find many examples of the kind of datasets I wished to test, but in the image you can see different types of data:\n\nhuman activity classification from smartphone data\ngesture classification by IMU data\nMNIST handwritten digits image data\nfree speech audio data\n\nWe can note a couple findings:\n\nPrincipal FFT is almost on par with PCA after a certain number of components\nPrincipalFFT definitely leaves PCA behind on audio data\n\nFrom even this simple analysis you should be convinced that Principal FFT can be (under certain cases) a fast, performant features extractor for your projects that involve time-dependant data.\nHow to use Principal FFT in Python\nI created a Python package to use Principal FFT, called principal-fft.\npip install principal-fft\nThe class follows the Transformer API from scikit-learn, so it has fit and transform methods.\nfrom principalfft import PrincipalFFT\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nmnist = load_digits()\nX, y = mnist.data, mnist.target\nXfft = PrincipalFFT(n_components=10).fit_transform(X)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\nXfft_train, Xfft_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(Xfft, y, test_size=0.3)\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(50, min_samples_leaf=5).fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(&quot;Raw score&quot;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(50, min_samples_leaf=5).fit(Xfft_train, y_train)\nprint(&quot;FFT score&quot;, clf.score(Xfft_test, y_test))\nMy results are 0.09 for raw data and 0.78 for FFT transformed: quite a big difference!\nAs with any dimensionality reduction, n_components is an hyperparameter you have to tune for your specific project: from my experiments, you shouldn't go lower than 8 to achieve a reasonable accuracy.\nHow to use Principal FFT in C\nSo, now that we tested our Principal FFT transformer in Python and achieved good results, how do we use it on our microcontroller? Of course with the micromlgen porter: it is now (version 1.1.9) able to port PrincipalFFT objects to plain C.\npip install micromlgen==1.1.9\nWhat does the C code look like?\nvoid principalFFT(float *features, float *fft) {\n    // apply principal FFT (naive implementation for the top 10 frequencies only)\n    const int topFrequencies[] = { 0, 8, 17, 16, 1, 9, 2, 7, 15, 6 };\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        const int k = topFrequencies[i];\n        const float harmonic = 0.09817477042468103 * k;\n        float re = 0;\n        float im = 0;\n\n        // optimized case\n        if (k == 0) {\n            for (int n = 0; n &lt; 64; n++) {\n                re += features[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        else {\n            for (int n = 0; n &lt; 64; n++) {\n                const float harmonic_n = harmonic * n;\n                const float cos_n = cos(harmonic_n);\n                const float sin_n = sin(harmonic_n);\n                re += features[n] * cos_n;\n                im -= features[n] * sin_n;\n            }\n        }\n\n        fft[i] = sqrt(re * re + im * im);\n    }\n}\nThis is the most direct porting available.\nIn the Benchmarks section, we'll see how this implementation can be speed-up with alternative implementations.\nBenchmarking\nThe following table reports the benchmark on the MNIST dataset (64 features) with 10 principal FFT components vs various tecniques to decrease the computation time at the expense of memory usage.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nFlash (Kb)\nExecution time (micros)\n\n\n\n\nNone\n137420\n-\n\n\narduinoFFT library\n147812\n3200\n\n\nprincipalFFT\n151404\n4400\n\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos+sin LUT\n152124\n900\n\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos LUT + sin sign LUT\n150220\n1250\n\n\n\n*all the benchmarks were run on the Arduino 33 Nano BLE Sense\nSome thoughts:\n\nprincipalFFT w/ cos+sin LUT means I pre-compute the values of sin and cos at compile time, so there's no computation on the board; of course these lookup tables will eat some memory\nprincipalFFT w/ cos LUT + sin sign LUT means I pre-compute the cos values only and compute sin using sqrt(1 - cos(x)^2); it adds some microseconds to the computation, but requires less memory\narduinoFFT library is faster than principalFFT in the execution time and requires less memory, even if principalFFT is only computing 10 frequencies: I need to investigate how it can achieve such performances\n\nYou can activate the LUT functionality with:\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom principalfft import PrincipalFFT\n\nfft = PrincipalFFT(n_components=10).fit(X)\n\n# cos lookup, sin computed\nport(fft, lookup_cos=True)\n\n# cos + sin lookup\nport(fft, lookup_cos=True, lookup_sin=True)\nHere's how the C code looks like with LUT.\nvoid principalFFT(float *features, float *fft) {\n    // apply principal FFT (naive implementation for the top N frequencies only)\n    const int topFrequencies[] = { 0, 8, 17, 16, 1, 9, 2, 7, 15, 6 };\n    const float cosLUT[10][64] = {\n        {  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0},\n        {  1.0,  0.7071,  6.1232e-17,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -1.8369e-16,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  3.0616e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -4.2862e-16,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  5.5109e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.4499e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -9.8033e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.6948e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -7.3540e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -2.9397e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -4.9047e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.1847e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -2.4554e-16,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.4296e-15,  0.7071,  1.0,  0.7071,  -6.1898e-19,  -0.7071,  -1.0,  -0.7071,  -3.6745e-15,  0.7071},   ... };\n    const bool sinLUT[10][64] = {\n        {  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false},\n        {  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false,  false,  false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  false,  false,  false},  ...};\n\n    for (int i = 0;

Capture audio samples</h2>\n<p>First of all, we need to capture a bunch of examples of the words we want to recognize.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/2019/12/word-classification-using-arduino/\">original post</a>, we used an analog microphone to record the audio. It is for sure the easiest way to interact with audio on a microcontroller since you only need to <code>analogRead()</code> the selected pin to get a value from the sensor.</p>\n<p>This semplicity, however, comes at the cost of a nearly inexistent signal pre-processing from the sensor itself: most of the time, you will get junk - I don't want to be rude, but that's it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toctheory-pulse-density-modulation-a-k-a-pdm\">Theory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)</h3>\n<p>The microphone mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (the <a href=\"https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Nano_BLE_Sense_mp34dt05-a.pdf\">MP34DT05</a>) is fortunately much better than this: it gives you access to a modulated signal much more suitable for our processing needs.</p>\n<p>The modulation used is pulse-density: I won't try to explain you how this works since I'm not an expert in DSP and neither it is the main scope of this article (refer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation\">Wikipedia</a> for some more information).</p>\n<p>What matters to us is that we can grab an array of bytes from the microphone and extract its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square\">Root Mean Square</a> (a.k.a. RMS) to be used as a feature for our Machine Learning model.</p>\n<p>I had some difficulty finding examples on how to access the microphone on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board: fortunately, there's a <a href=\"https://github.com/DaleGia/nano-33-sense-serial-example\">Github repo</a> from <em>DelaGia</em> that shows how to access all the sensors of the board.</p>\n<p>I extracted the microphone part and incapsulated it in an easy to use class, so you don't really need to dig into the implementation details if you're not interested.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tocpractice-the-code-to-capture-the-samples\">Practice: the code to capture the samples</h3>\n<p>When loaded on your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, the following sketch will await for you to speak in front of the microphone: once it detects a sound, it will record  64 audio values and print them to the serial monitor.</p>\n<p>From my experience, 64 samples are sufficient to cover short words such as <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>stop</em>: if you plan to classify longer words, you may need to increase this number.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">I suggest you keep the words short: longer words will probably decrease the accuracy of the model. If you want nonetheless a longer duration, at least keep the number of words as low as possible</div>\n<p>Download the <a href=\"https://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arduino-33-ble-sense-capture-audio-samples.zip\" title=\"Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples\">Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples sketch</a>, open it the Arduino IDE and flash it to your board.</p>\n<p>Here's the main code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &quot;Mic.h&quot;\n\n// tune as per your needs\n#define SAMPLES 64\n#define GAIN (1.0f/50)\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 2000\n\nfloat features[SAMPLES];\nMic mic;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    PDM.onReceive(onAudio);\n    mic.begin();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // await for a word to be pronounced\n    if (recordAudioSample()) {\n        // print features to serial monitor\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            Serial.print(features[i], 6);\n            Serial.print(i == SAMPLES - 1 ? &#039;\\n&#039; : &#039;,&#039;);\n        }\n\n        delay(1000);\n    }\n\n    delay(20);\n}\n\n/**\n * PDM callback to update mic object\n */\nvoid onAudio() {\n    mic.update();\n}\n\n/**\n * Read given number of samples from mic\n */\nbool recordAudioSample() {\n    if (mic.hasData() &amp;&amp; mic.data() &gt; SOUND_THRESHOLD) {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            while (!mic.hasData())\n                delay(1);\n\n            features[i] = mic.pop() * GAIN;\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have the acquisition logic in place, it's time for you to record some samples of the words you want to classify. </p>\n<h3 id=\"tocaction-capture-the-words-examples\">Action: capture the words examples</h3>\n<p>Now you have to capture as many samples of the words you want to classify as possible.</p>\n<p>Open the serial monitor and pronounce a word near the microphone: a line of numbers will be printed on the monitor.</p>\n<p>This is the <em>description</em> of your word.</p>\n<p>You need many lines like this for an accurate prediction, so keep repeating the same word 15-30 times.</p>\n<div class=\"my-advice\">**My advice**: while recording the samples, vary both the distance of your mounth from the mic and the intensity of your voice: this will produce a more robust classification model later on.</div>\n<p>After you repeated the same words many times, copy the content of the serial monitor and save it in a CSV file named after the word, for example <code>yes.csv</code>.</p>\n<p>Then clear the serial monitor and repeat the process for each word.</p>\n<p>Keep all these files in a folder because we need them to train our classifier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocstep-2-train-the-machine-learning-model\">Step 2. Train the machine learning model</h2>\n<p>Now that we have the samples, it's time to train the classifier.</p>\n<p>Create a Python project in your favourite IDE or use your favourite text editor, if you don't have one.</p>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"/2019/11/how-to-train-a-classifier-in-scikit-learn/\">my post about how to train a classifier</a>, we create a Python script that reads all the files inside a folder and concatenates them in a single array you feed to the classifier model.</p>\n<p>Be sure your folder structure is like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>ArduinoWordClassification\n  |-- train_classifier.py\n  |-- data/\n  |---- yes.csv\n  |---- no.csv\n  |---- play.csv\n  |---- any other .csv file you recorded</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># file: train_classifier.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndef load_features(folder):\n    dataset = None\n    classmap = {}\n    for class_idx, filename in enumerate(glob(&#039;%s/*.csv&#039; % folder)):\n        class_name = basename(filename)[:-4]\n        classmap[class_idx] = class_name\n        samples = np.loadtxt(filename, dtype=float, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)\n        labels = np.ones((len(samples), 1)) * class_idx\n        samples = np.hstack((samples, labels))\n        dataset = samples if dataset is None else np.vstack((dataset, samples))\n    return dataset, classmap\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\ndataset, classmap = load_features(&#039;data&#039;)\nX, y = dataset[:, :-1], dataset[:, -1]\n# this line is for testing your accuracy only: once you&#039;re satisfied with the results, set test_size to 1\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nclf = SVC(kernel=&#039;poly&#039;, degree=2, gamma=0.1, C=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(&#039;Accuracy&#039;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\nprint(&#039;Exported classifier to plain C&#039;)\nprint(port(clf, classmap=classmap))</code></pre>\n<p>Among the classifiers I tried, SVM produced the best accuracy at 96% with 32 support vectors: it's not a super-tiny model, but it's quite small nevertheless.</p>\n<p>If you're not satisifed with SVM, you can use Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Relevant Vector Machines.

            "content_text": "Let's revamp the post I wrote about word classification using Machine Learning on Arduino, this time using a proper microphone (the MP34DT05 mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense) instead of a chinese, analog one: will the results improve?\nfrom https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-audio-processing-complete-engineers-course/\n\nUpdated on 16 October 2020: step by step explanation of the process with ready-made sketch code\nTable of contentsWhat you'll learnWhat you'll needStep 1. Capture audio samplesTheory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)Practice: the code to capture the samplesAction: capture the words examplesStep 2. Train the machine learning modelStep 3. Deploy to your microcontroller\nWhat you'll learn\nThis tutorial will teach you how to capture audio from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microphone and classify it: at the end of this post, you will have a trained model able to detect in real-time the word you tell, among the ones that you trained it to recognize. The classification will occur directly on your Arduino board.\nThis is not a general-purpose speech recognizer able to convert speech-to-text: it works only on the words you train it on.\nWhat you'll need\n\n\nHardware\n\nArduino Nano 33 BLE Sense\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\nPython\nPython's module scikit-learn\nPython's module micromlgen\n\n\n\nTo install the software, open your terminal and install the libraries.\npip install -U scikit-learn\npip install -U micromlgen\nStep 1. Capture audio samples\nFirst of all, we need to capture a bunch of examples of the words we want to recognize.\nIn the original post, we used an analog microphone to record the audio. It is for sure the easiest way to interact with audio on a microcontroller since you only need to analogRead() the selected pin to get a value from the sensor.\nThis semplicity, however, comes at the cost of a nearly inexistent signal pre-processing from the sensor itself: most of the time, you will get junk - I don't want to be rude, but that's it.\nTheory: Pulse-density modulation (a.k.a. PDM)\nThe microphone mounted on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (the MP34DT05) is fortunately much better than this: it gives you access to a modulated signal much more suitable for our processing needs.\nThe modulation used is pulse-density: I won't try to explain you how this works since I'm not an expert in DSP and neither it is the main scope of this article (refer to Wikipedia for some more information).\nWhat matters to us is that we can grab an array of bytes from the microphone and extract its Root Mean Square (a.k.a. RMS) to be used as a feature for our Machine Learning model.\nI had some difficulty finding examples on how to access the microphone on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board: fortunately, there's a Github repo from DelaGia that shows how to access all the sensors of the board.\nI extracted the microphone part and incapsulated it in an easy to use class, so you don't really need to dig into the implementation details if you're not interested.\nPractice: the code to capture the samples\nWhen loaded on your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, the following sketch will await for you to speak in front of the microphone: once it detects a sound, it will record  64 audio values and print them to the serial monitor.\nFrom my experience, 64 samples are sufficient to cover short words such as yes, no, play, stop: if you plan to classify longer words, you may need to increase this number.\nI suggest you keep the words short: longer words will probably decrease the accuracy of the model. If you want nonetheless a longer duration, at least keep the number of words as low as possible\nDownload the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Capture audio samples sketch, open it the Arduino IDE and flash it to your board.\nHere's the main code.\n#include &quot;Mic.h&quot;\n\n// tune as per your needs\n#define SAMPLES 64\n#define GAIN (1.0f/50)\n#define SOUND_THRESHOLD 2000\n\nfloat features[SAMPLES];\nMic mic;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    PDM.onReceive(onAudio);\n    mic.begin();\n    delay(3000);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // await for a word to be pronounced\n    if (recordAudioSample()) {\n        // print features to serial monitor\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            Serial.print(features[i], 6);\n            Serial.print(i == SAMPLES - 1 ? &#039;\\n&#039; : &#039;,&#039;);\n        }\n\n        delay(1000);\n    }\n\n    delay(20);\n}\n\n/**\n * PDM callback to update mic object\n */\nvoid onAudio() {\n    mic.update();\n}\n\n/**\n * Read given number of samples from mic\n */\nbool recordAudioSample() {\n    if (mic.hasData() &amp;&amp; mic.data() &gt; SOUND_THRESHOLD) {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SAMPLES; i++) {\n            while (!mic.hasData())\n                delay(1);\n\n            features[i] = mic.pop() * GAIN;\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\nNow that we have the acquisition logic in place, it's time for you to record some samples of the words you want to classify. \nAction: capture the words examples\nNow you have to capture as many samples of the words you want to classify as possible.\nOpen the serial monitor and pronounce a word near the microphone: a line of numbers will be printed on the monitor.\nThis is the description of your word.\nYou need many lines like this for an accurate prediction, so keep repeating the same word 15-30 times.\n**My advice**: while recording the samples, vary both the distance of your mounth from the mic and the intensity of your voice: this will produce a more robust classification model later on.\nAfter you repeated the same words many times, copy the content of the serial monitor and save it in a CSV file named after the word, for example yes.csv.\nThen clear the serial monitor and repeat the process for each word.\nKeep all these files in a folder because we need them to train our classifier.\nStep 2. Train the machine learning model\nNow that we have the samples, it's time to train the classifier.\nCreate a Python project in your favourite IDE or use your favourite text editor, if you don't have one.\nAs described in my post about how to train a classifier, we create a Python script that reads all the files inside a folder and concatenates them in a single array you feed to the classifier model.\nBe sure your folder structure is like the following:\nArduinoWordClassification\n  |-- train_classifier.py\n  |-- data/\n  |---- yes.csv\n  |---- no.csv\n  |---- play.csv\n  |---- any other .csv file you recorded\n# file: train_classifier.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom micromlgen import port\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndef load_features(folder):\n    dataset = None\n    classmap = {}\n    for class_idx, filename in enumerate(glob(&#039;%s/*.csv&#039; % folder)):\n        class_name = basename(filename)[:-4]\n        classmap[class_idx] = class_name\n        samples = np.loadtxt(filename, dtype=float, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)\n        labels = np.ones((len(samples), 1)) * class_idx\n        samples = np.hstack((samples, labels))\n        dataset = samples if dataset is None else np.vstack((dataset, samples))\n    return dataset, classmap\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\ndataset, classmap = load_features(&#039;data&#039;)\nX, y = dataset[:, :-1], dataset[:, -1]\n# this line is for testing your accuracy only: once you&#039;re satisfied with the results, set test_size to 1\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nclf = SVC(kernel=&#039;poly&#039;, degree=2, gamma=0.1, C=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(&#039;Accuracy&#039;, clf.score(X_test, y_test))\nprint(&#039;Exported classifier to plain C&#039;)\nprint(port(clf, classmap=classmap))\nAmong the classifiers I tried, SVM produced the best accuracy at 96% with 32 support vectors: it's not a super-tiny model, but it's quite small nevertheless.\nIf you're not satisifed with SVM, you can use Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Relevant Vector Machines. See my other posts for a detailed description of each.\nIn your console, after the accuracy score, you will have the plain C implementation of the classifier you trained.

Deploy to your microcontroller\nNow we have all the pieces we need to perform word classification on our Arduino board.\nDownload the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense - Audio classification sketch, open it in the Arduino IDE and paste the plain C code you got in the console inside the Classifier.h file (delete all its contents before!).\nFine: it's time to deploy!\nHit the upload button: if everything went fine, open the serial monitor and pronounce one of the words you recorded during Step 1.\nHopefully, you will read the word on the serial monitor.\nHere's a quick demo (please forgive me for the bad video quality).\n\nhttps://eloquentarduino.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Arduino-Nano-33-BLE-Sense-Word-classification.mp4\n\nIf you liked this tutorial and it helped you successfully implement word classification on your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, please share it on your social media so others can benefit too.\nIf you have troubles or questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment: I will be happy to help you.\nL'articolo Better word classification with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Machine Learning proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

The method I present you in this post, instead, is by far way simpler to follow.</p>\n<p>First of all, you will need a Wifi equipped board. I will use an <a href=\"https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010\">Arduino MKR WiFi 1010</a>, but any ESP8266 / ESP32 or the like will work.</p>\n<p>The following sketch will do the job: it scans the visible networks at a regular interval and prints their RSSIs encoded in JSON format.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">// file DataGathering.h\n\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n\n#define print(string) Serial.print(string);\n#define quote(string) print(&#039;&quot;&#039;); print(string); print(&#039;&quot;&#039;);\n\nString location = &quot;&quot;;\n\n/**\n * \n */\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  delay(3000);\n  WiFi.disconnect();\n}\n\n/**\n * \n */\nvoid loop() {  \n  // if location is set, scan networks\n  if (location != &quot;&quot;) {\n    int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n    // print location\n    print(&#039;{&#039;);\n    quote(&quot;__location&quot;);\n    print(&quot;: &quot;);\n    quote(location);\n    print(&quot;, &quot;);\n\n    // print each network SSID and RSSI\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n      quote(WiFi.SSID(i));\n      print(&quot;: &quot;);\n      print(WiFi.RSSI(i));\n      print(i == numNetworks - 1 ? &quot;}\\n&quot; : &quot;, &quot;);\n    }\n\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n  // else wait for user to enter the location\n  else {\n    String input;\n\n    Serial.println(&quot;Enter &#039;scan {location}&#039; to start the scanning&quot;);\n\n    while (!Serial.available())\n      delay(200);\n\n    input = Serial.readStringUntil(&#039;\\n&#039;);\n\n    if (input.indexOf(&quot;scan &quot;) == 0) {\n      input.replace(&quot;scan &quot;, &quot;&quot;);\n      location = input;\n    }\n    else {\n      location = &quot;&quot;;\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Upload the sketch to your board and start mapping your house / office: go to the target location and type <code>scan {location}</code> in the serial monitor, where <code>{location}</code>is the name you want to give to the current location (so, for example, if you're mapping the kitchen, type <code>scan kitchen</code>).</p>\n<p>Move around the room a bit so you capture a few variations of the visible hotspots: this will lead to a more robust classification later on.</p>\n<p>To stop the recording just type <code>stop</code> in the serial monitor.</p>\n<p>Now repeat this process for each location you want to classify. At this point you should have ended with something similar to the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bedroom&quot;, &quot;N3&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N5&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}</code></pre>\n<p>In your case, &quot;N1&quot;, &quot;N2&quot;... will contain the name of the visible networks.</p>\n<p>When you're happy with your training data, it's time to convert it to something useful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocgenerating-the-features-converter\">Generating the features converter</h2>\n<p>Given the data we have, we want to generate C code that can convert a Wifi scan result into a feature vector we can use for classification.</p>\n<p>Since I'm a fan of code-generators, I wrote one specifically for this very project. And since I already have a code-generator library I use for Machine Learning code written in Python, I updated it with this new functionality.</p>\n<div class=\"watchout\">You must have Python installed on your system</div>\n<p>Start by installing the library.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># be sure it installs version &gt;= 1.1.8\npip install --upgrade micromlgen</code></pre>\n<p>Now create a script with the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from micromlgen import port_wifi_indoor_positioning\n\nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    samples = &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bedroom&quot;, &quot;N3&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N5&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    X, y, classmap, converter_code = port_wifi_indoor_positioning(samples)\n    print(converter_code)</code></pre>\n<p>Of course you have to replace the <code>samples</code> content with the output you got in the previous step. </p>\n<p>In the console you should see a C++ class we will use later in the Arduino sketch.

            "content_text": "This will be the most detailed, easy to follow tutorial over the Web on how to implement Wifi indoor positioning using an Arduino microcontroller and Machine Learning. It contains all the steps, tools and code from the start to the end of the project.\n\nri-elaborated from https://www.accuware.com/blog/ambient-signals-plus-video-images/\n\nMy original post abot Wifi indoor positioning is one of my top-performing post of all time (after motion detection using ESP32 camera and the introductory post on Machine Learning for Arduino). This is why I settled to revamp it and add some more details, tools and scripts to create the most complete free guide on how to implement such a system, from the beginning to the end.\nThis post will cover all the necessary steps and provide all the code you need: for an introduction to the topic, I point you to the original post.\nTable of contentsFeatures definitionData gatheringGenerating the features converterGenerating the classifierWrapping it all togetherDisclaimer\nFeatures definition\nThis part stays the same as the original post: we will use the RSSIs (signal strength) of the nearby Wifi hotspots to classifiy which location we're in.\nEach location will &quot;see&quot; a certain number of networks, each with a RSSI that will stay mostly the same: the unique combination of these RSSIs will become a fingerprint to distinguish the locations from one another.\nSince not all networks will be visible all the time, the shape of our data will be more likely a sparse matrix.\nA sparse matrix is a matrix where most of the elements will be zero, meaning the absence of the given feature. Only the relevant elements will be non-zero and will represent the RSSI of the nth network.\nThe following example table should give you an idea of what our data will look like.\n\n\n\nLocation\nNet #1\nNet #2\nNet #3\nNet #4\nNet #5\nNet #6\nNet #7\n\n\n\n\nKitchen/1\n50\n30\n60\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nKitchen/2\n55\n30\n55\n0\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nKitchen/3\n50\n35\n65\n0\n0\n0\n5\n\n\nBedroom/1\n0\n80\n0\n80\n0\n40\n40\n\n\nBedroom/2\n0\n80\n0\n85\n10\n20\n20\n\n\nBedroom/3\n0\n70\n0\n85\n0\n30\n40\n\n\nBathroom/1\n0\n0\n30\n80\n80\n0\n0\n\n\nBathroom/2\n0\n0\n10\n90\n85\n0\n0\n\n\nBathroom/3\n0\n0\n30\n90\n90\n5\n0\n\n\n\nEven though the numbers in this table are fake, you should recognize a pattern:\n\neach location is characterized by a certain combination of always-visible networks\nsome sample could be &quot;noised&quot; by weak networks (the 5 in the table)\n\nOur machine learning algorithm should be able to extract each location's fingerprint without being fooled by this inconsistent features.\nData gathering\nNow that we know what our data should look like, we need to first get it.\nIn the original post, this point was the one I'm unhappy with since it's not as straight-forward as I would have liked. The method I present you in this post, instead, is by far way simpler to follow.\nFirst of all, you will need a Wifi equipped board. I will use an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, but any ESP8266 / ESP32 or the like will work.\nThe following sketch will do the job: it scans the visible networks at a regular interval and prints their RSSIs encoded in JSON format.\n// file DataGathering.h\n\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n\n#define print(string) Serial.print(string);\n#define quote(string) print(&#039;&quot;&#039;); print(string); print(&#039;&quot;&#039;);\n\nString location = &quot;&quot;;\n\n/**\n * \n */\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  delay(3000);\n  WiFi.disconnect();\n}\n\n/**\n * \n */\nvoid loop() {  \n  // if location is set, scan networks\n  if (location != &quot;&quot;) {\n    int numNetworks = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n\n    // print location\n    print(&#039;{&#039;);\n    quote(&quot;__location&quot;);\n    print(&quot;: &quot;);\n    quote(location);\n    print(&quot;, &quot;);\n\n    // print each network SSID and RSSI\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numNetworks; i++) {\n      quote(WiFi.SSID(i));\n      print(&quot;: &quot;);\n      print(WiFi.RSSI(i));\n      print(i == numNetworks - 1 ? &quot;}\\n&quot; : &quot;, &quot;);\n    }\n\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n  // else wait for user to enter the location\n  else {\n    String input;\n\n    Serial.println(&quot;Enter &#039;scan {location}&#039; to start the scanning&quot;);\n\n    while (!Serial.available())\n      delay(200);\n\n    input = Serial.readStringUntil(&#039;\\n&#039;);\n\n    if (input.indexOf(&quot;scan &quot;) == 0) {\n      input.replace(&quot;scan &quot;, &quot;&quot;);\n      location = input;\n    }\n    else {\n      location = &quot;&quot;;\n    }\n  }\n}\nUpload the sketch to your board and start mapping your house / office: go to the target location and type scan {location} in the serial monitor, where {location}is the name you want to give to the current location (so, for example, if you're mapping the kitchen, type scan kitchen).\nMove around the room a bit so you capture a few variations of the visible hotspots: this will lead to a more robust classification later on.\nTo stop the recording just type stop in the serial monitor.\nNow repeat this process for each location you want to classify. At this point you should have ended with something similar to the following:\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bedroom&quot;, &quot;N3&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n{&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N5&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\nIn your case, &quot;N1&quot;, &quot;N2&quot;... will contain the name of the visible networks.\nWhen you're happy with your training data, it's time to convert it to something useful.\nGenerating the features converter\nGiven the data we have, we want to generate C code that can convert a Wifi scan result into a feature vector we can use for classification.\nSince I'm a fan of code-generators, I wrote one specifically for this very project. And since I already have a code-generator library I use for Machine Learning code written in Python, I updated it with this new functionality.\nYou must have Python installed on your system\nStart by installing the library.\n# be sure it installs version &gt;= 1.1.8\npip install --upgrade micromlgen\nNow create a script with the following code:\nfrom micromlgen import port_wifi_indoor_positioning\n\nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    samples = &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bedroom&quot;, &quot;N3&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N5&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    X, y, classmap, converter_code = port_wifi_indoor_positioning(samples)\n    print(converter_code)\nOf course you have to replace the samples content with the output you got in the previous step. \nIn the console you should see a C++ class we will use later in the Arduino sketch.

Since we already have micromlgen installed, it will be very easy to do so.\nLet's update the Python code we already have: this time, instead of printing the converter code, we will print the classifier code.\n# install ml package first\npip install scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom micromlgen import port_wifi_indoor_positioning, port\n\nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    samples = &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bedroom&quot;, &quot;N3&quot;: 100, &quot;N2&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N1&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    {&quot;__location&quot;: &quot;Bathroom&quot;, &quot;N5&quot;: 100, &quot;N4&quot;: 50}\n    &#039;&#039;&#039;\n    X, y, classmap, converter_code = port_wifi_indoor_positioning(samples)\n    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n    clf.fit(X, y)\n    print(port(clf, classmap=classmap))\nHere I chose Decision tree because it is a very lightweight algorithm and should work fine for the kind of features we're working with.\nIf you're not satisfied with the results, you can try to use SVM or Gaussian Naive Bayes, which are both supported by micromlgen.\nIn the console you will see the generated code for the classifier you trained. In the case of DecisionTree the code will look like the following.\n// Save this code in your sketch as Classifier.h\n\n#pragma once\nnamespace Eloquent {\n    namespace ML {\n        namespace Port {\n            class DecisionTree {\n                public:\n                    /**\n                    * Predict class for features vector\n                    */\n                    int predict(float *x) {\n                        if (x[2] &lt;= 25.0) {\n                            if (x[4] &lt;= 50.0) {\n                                return 1;\n                            }\n\n                            else {\n                                return 2;\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        else {\n                            return 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    /**\n                    * Convert class idx to readable name\n                    */\n                    const char* predictLabel(float *x) {\n                        switch (predict(x)) {\n                            case 0:\n                            return &quot;Bathroom&quot;;\n                            case 1:\n                            return &quot;Bedroom&quot;;\n                            case 2:\n                            return &quot;Kitchen&quot;;\n                            default:\n                            return &quot;Houston we have a problem&quot;;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                protected:\n                };\n            }\n        }\n    }\nWrapping it all together\nNow that we have all the pieces together, we only need to merge them to get a complete working example.\n// file WifiIndoorPositioning.h\n\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n#include &quot;Converter.h&quot;\n#include &quot;Classifier.h&quot;\n\nEloquent::Projects::WifiIndoorPositioning positioning;\nEloquent::ML::Port::DecisionTree classifier;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  Serial.print(&quot;You&#039;re in &quot;);\n  Serial.println(classifier.predictLabel(positioning.getFeatures()));\n  delay(3000);\n}\nTo the bare minimum, the above code runs the scan and tells you which location you're in. That's it.\nDisclaimer\nThis system should be pretty accurate and robust if you properly gather the data, though I can quantify how much accurate.\nThis is not an indoor navigation system: it can't tell you &quot;the coordinates&quot; of where you are, it can only detect in which room you're in.\nIf your location lack of nearby Wifi hotspots, an easy and cheap solution would be to spawn a bunch of ESP8266 / ESP32 boards around your house each acting as Access Point: with this simple trick you should be able to be as accurate as needed by just adding more boards.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWith this in-depth tutorial I hope I helped you going from start to end of setting up a Wifi indoor positioning system using cheap hardware as ESP8266 / ESP32 boards and the Arduino IDE. \nAs you can see, Machine learning has not to be intimidating even for beginners: you just need the right tools to get the job done.\nIf this guide excited you about Machine learning on microcontrollers, I invite you to read the many other posts I wrote on the topic and share them on the socials.\nYou can find the whole project on Github.

            "content_text": "Are you looking for a top-performer classifiers with a minimal amount of parameters to tune? Look no further: Gaussian Naive Bayes is what you're looking for. And thanks to EloquentML you can now port it to your microcontroller.\n\n\n(Gaussian) Naive Bayes\nNaive Bayes classifiers are simple models based on the probability theory that can be used for classification.\nThey originate from the assumption of independence among the input variables. Even though this assumption doesn't hold true in the vast majority of the cases, they often perform very good at many classification tasks, so they're quite popular.\nGaussian Naive Bayes stack another (mostly wrong) assumption: that the variables exhibit a Gaussian probability distribution.\nI (and many others like me) will never understand how it is possible that so many wrong assumptions lead to such good performances!\nNevertheless, what is important to us is that sklearn implements GaussianNB, so we easily train such a classifier.\nThe most interesting part is that GaussianNB can be tuned with just a single parameter: var_smoothing.\nDon't ask me what it does in theory: in practice you change it and your accuracy can boost. This leads to an easy tuning process that doesn't involves expensive grid search.\nimport sklearn.datasets as d\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import normalize\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\ndef pick_best(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):\n    best = (None, 0)\n    for var_smoothing in range(-7, 1):\n        clf = GaussianNB(var_smoothing=pow(10, var_smoothing))\n        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n        accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).sum()\n        if accuracy &gt; best[1]:\n            best = (clf, accuracy)\n    print(&#039;best accuracy&#039;, best[1] / len(y_test))\n    return best[0]\n\niris = d.load_iris()\nX = normalize(iris.data)\ny = iris.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\nclf = pick_best(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)\nThis simple procedure will train a bunch of classifiers with a different var_smoothing factor and pick the best performing one.\nEloquentML integration\nOnce you have your trained classifier, porting it to C is as easy as always:\nfrom micromlgen import port\n\nclf = pick_best()\nprint(port(clf))\nAlways remember to run \npip install --upgrade micromlgen\n\nport is a magic method able to port many classifiers: it will automatically detect the proper converter for you.\nWhat does the exported code looks like?\n#pragma once\nnamespace Eloquent {\n    namespace ML {\n        namespace Port {\n            class GaussianNB {\n                public:\n                    /**\n                    * Predict class for features vector\n                    */\n                    int predict(float *x) {\n                        float votes[3] = { 0.0f };\n                        float theta[4] = { 0 };\n                        float sigma[4] = { 0 };\n                        theta[0] = 0.801139789889; theta[1] = 0.54726920354; theta[2] = 0.234408773313; theta[3] = 0.039178084094;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000366881742; sigma[1] = 0.000907992556; sigma[2] = 0.000740960787; sigma[3] = 0.000274925514;\n                        votes[0] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        theta[0] = 0.748563871324; theta[1] = 0.349390892644; theta[2] = 0.536186138345; theta[3] = 0.166747384117;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000529727082; sigma[1] = 0.000847956504; sigma[2] = 0.000690057342; sigma[3] = 0.000311828658;\n                        votes[1] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        theta[0] = 0.704497203305; theta[1] = 0.318862439835; theta[2] = 0.593755956917; theta[3] = 0.217288784452;\n                        sigma[0] = 0.000363782089; sigma[1] = 0.000813846722; sigma[2] = 0.000415475678; sigma[3] = 0.000758478249;\n                        votes[2] = 0.333333333333 - gauss(x, theta, sigma);\n                        // return argmax of votes\n                        uint8_t classIdx = 0;\n                        float maxVotes = votes[0];\n\n                        for (uint8_t i = 1; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n                            if (votes[i] &gt; maxVotes) {\n                                classIdx = i;\n                                maxVotes = votes[i];\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        return classIdx;\n                    }\n\n                protected:\n                    /**\n                    * Compute gaussian value\n                    */\n                    float gauss(float *x, float *theta, float *sigma) {\n                        float gauss = 0.0f;\n\n                        for (uint16_t i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {\n                            gauss += log(sigma[i]);\n                            gauss += pow(x[i] - theta[i], 2) / sigma[i];\n                        }\n\n                        return gauss;\n                    }\n                };\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAs you can see, we need a couple of &quot;weight vectors&quot;:\n\ntheta is the mean of each feature\nsigma is the standard deviation\n\nThe computation is quite thin: just a couple of operations; the class with the highest score is then selected.\nBenchmarks\nFollowing there's a recap of a couple benchmarks I run on an Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense.\n\n\n\nClassifier\nDataset\nFlash\nRAM\nExecution time\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nGaussianNB\nIris (150x4)\n82 kb\n42 Kb\n65 ms\n97%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nIris (150x4)\n83 Kb\n42 Kb\n76 ms\n99%\n\n\nGaussianNB\nBreast cancer (80x40)\n90 Kb\n42 Kb\n160 ms\n77%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nBreast cancer (80x40)\n112 Kb\n42 Kb\n378 ms\n73%\n\n\nGaussianNB\nWine (100x13)\n85 Kb\n42 Kb\n130 ms\n97%\n\n\nLinearSVC\nWine (100x13)\n89 Kb\n42 Kb\n125 ms\n99%\n\n\n\nWe can see that the accuracy is on par with a linear SVM, reaching up to 97% on some datasets.

You can achieve this task in the way you prefer: ESP32Camera class makes this a breeze.\n81 in the server constructor is the port you want the server to be listening to.\nOnce connected to WiFi or started in AP mode, all you have to do is call start(): that's it!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tFinding this content useful?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWhat else is it good for?\nThe main reason I wrote this piece of library is because one of you reader commented on the motion detection post asking if it would be possible to start the video streaming once motion is detected.\nOf course it is.\nIt's just a matter of composing the Eloquent pieces.\n#define CAMERA_MODEL_M5STACK_WIDE\n#include &quot;WiFi.h&quot;\n#include &quot;EloquentVision.h&quot;\n#include &quot;ESP32CameraHTTPVideoStreamingServer.h&quot;\n\n#define SOURCE_WIDTH 320\n#define SOURCE_HEIGHT 240\n#define BLOCK_SIZE 10\n#define BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.2\n#define IMAGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD 0.1\n\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::Camera;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::ImageProcessing;\nusing namespace Eloquent::Vision::ImageProcessing::Downscale;\n\nESP32Camera camera;\nHTTPVideoStreamingServer server(81);\nMotionDetection&lt; SOURCE_WIDTH, SOURCE_HEIGHT, BLOCK_SIZE&gt; motion(nearest);\n\n/**\n *\n */\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    WiFi.softAP(&quot;ESP32&quot;, &quot;12345678&quot;);\n\n    camera.begin(FRAMESIZE_QVGA, PIXFORMAT_JPEG);\n\n    Serial.print(&quot;Camera Ready! Use &#039;http://&quot;);\n    Serial.print(WiFi.softAPIP());\n    Serial.println(&quot;:81&#039; to stream&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    motion.update(camera.capture()-&gt;buf);\n\n    if (motion.detectRatio() &gt; IMAGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD) {\n        Serial.print(&quot;Motion detected&quot;);\n        // start the streaming server when motion is detected\n        // shutdown after 20 seconds if no one connects\n        server.start();\n        delay(20000);\n        server.stop();\n    }\n\n    // probably we don&#039;t need 30 fps, save some power\n    delay(300);\n}\nDoes it look good?\nNow the rationale behind Eloquent components should be starting to be clear to you: easy to use objects you can compose the way it fits to achieve the result you want.\nWould you suggest me more piece of functionality you would like to see wrapped in an Eloquent component?\n\nYou can find the class code and the example sketch on the Github repo.\nL'articolo Easy ESP32 camera HTTP video streaming server proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",

It means your board has to do many less computations to give you a prediction and will probably be able to host a more complex model.\nLet's check out the figures with n_components = 10 compared with the ones without PCA.\n\n\n\nKernel\nPCA support vectors\nPCA flash size\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nRBF C=10\n46 (+24%)\n32 Kb (-40%)\n99%\n\n\nRBF C=100\n28 (-54%)\n32 Kb (-60%)\n99%\n\n\nPoly 2\n13 (-48%)\n28 Kb (+12%)\n99%\n\n\nPoly 3\n24 (-4%)\n32 Kb (-20%)\n99%\n\n\nLinear\n18 (-64%)\n29 Kb (-47%)\n99%\n\n\n\nA couple notes:\n\naccuracy increased (on stayed the same) for all kernels\nwith one exception, flash size decreased in the range 20 - 50%\nnow we can fit 3 classifiers on our Arduino UNO instead of only one\n\nI will probably spend some more time investingating the usefulness of PCA for Arduino Machine Learning projects, but for now that's it: it's a good starting point in my opinion.\n\nThere's a little example sketch on Github that applies PCA to the IRIS dataset.\nTell me what you think may be a clever application of dimensionality reduction in the world of microcontrollers and see if we can build something great together.\nL'articolo Arduino dimensionality reduction (PCA) for Machine Learning projects proviene da Eloquent Arduino Blog.",
